1,17502098L1,17502098,"it contains a bar and a ph domain near its n terminus, and the two domains may function as a unit (bar ph domain)."
2,17502098L2,17502098,we report here the crystal structures of the bar ph and ptb domains of human appl1.
3,17502098L3,17502098,the structures reveal novel features for bar domain dimerization and for the interactions between the bar and ph domains.
4,17502098L4,17502098,"the bar domain dimer of appl1 contains two four helical bundles, whereas other bar domain dimers have only three helices in each bundle."
5,17502098L5,17502098,the ph domain is located at the opposite ends of the bar domain dimer.
6,17502098L6,17502098,yeast two hybrid assays confirm the interactions between the bar and ph domains.
7,17502098L7,17502098,"lipid binding assays show that the bar, ph, and ptb domains can bind phospholipids."
8,17502098L8,17502098,the ability of appl1 to interact with multiple signaling molecules and phospholipids supports an important role for this adaptor in cell signaling.
9,19674112L0,19674112,"the gamma aminobutyrate type a receptor associated protein (gabarap) is a ubiquitin like modifier, and is implicated in a variety of membrane trafficking and fusion events that are crucial to synaptic plasticity, autophagy and apoptosis."
10,19674112L1,19674112,"however, important aspects of gabarap function and regulation remain poorly understood."
11,19674112L2,19674112,"we review the current state of knowledge about gabarap, highlighting newly identified gabarap ligands, and discuss the possible physiological relevance of each ligand interaction."
12,10402955L0,10402955,there are two phases of somatic muscle formation in drosophila.
13,10402955L1,10402955,"during embryonic development, one phase of myogenesis generates larval muscle elements that mediate the relatively simple behavioural repertoire of the larva."
14,10402955L2,10402955,"during pupal metamorphosis, a diverse pattern of muscle fibres are assembled, and these facilitate the more elaborate behavioural patterns of the adult fly."
15,10402955L3,10402955,"in this review, we discuss the current status of understanding of the cellular, genetic, and molecular mechanisms of pattern formation during the second phase, imaginal muscle development."
16,10402955L4,10402955,we briefly compare aspects of embryonic and adult myogenesis in drosophila and muscle development in vertebrates and highlight conserved themes and disparities between these diverse myogenic programmes.
17,23014857L0,23014857,phenolic compounds were applied in a sausage formulation as a substitute for artificial sodium erythorbate used as antioxidant.
18,23014857L1,23014857,five assays were prepared in which sodium erythorbate control at 0.05 g/100 g was replaced with a hydrosoluble mixture containing caffeic acid + carnosic acid (47% + 53%) and a liposoluble mixture containing quercetin + rutin (67% + 33%) in two final concentrations (0.05 g/100 g and 0.08 g/100 g).
19,23014857L2,23014857,"physico chemical, color, texture, and sensory parameters were measured on the first day and after 45 days of storage at 4 °c."

21,23014857L4,23014857,"the mixture containing quercetin + rutin at 0.05 g/100 g showed lower malondialdehyde formation after 45 days of storage, and no sensory differences from the sausage adopted as control."
22,10801286L0,10801286,we investigated the existence of an endogenous system for lactate transport in xenopus laevis oocytes.
23,10801286L1,10801286,(36)cl uptake studies excluded the involvement of a dids sensitive anion antiporter as a possible pathway for lactate movement.
24,10801286L2,10801286,"l [(14)c]lactate uptake was unaffected by superimposed ph gradients, stimulated by the presence of na(+) in the incubating solution, and severely reduced by the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor p chloromercuribenzenesulphonate (pcmbs)."
25,10801286L3,10801286,"transport exhibited a broad cation specificity and was cis inhibited by other monocarboxylates, mostly by pyruvate."
26,10801286L4,10801286,these results suggest that lactate uptake is mediated mainly by a transporter and that the preferred anion is pyruvate.
27,10801286L5,10801286,[(14)c]pyruvate uptake exhibited the same pattern of functional properties evidenced for l lactate.
28,10801286L6,10801286,"kinetic parameters were calculated for both monocarboxylates, and a higher affinity for pyruvate was revealed."
29,10801286L7,10801286,various inhibitors of monocarboxylate transporters reduced significantly pyruvate uptake.
30,10801286L8,10801286,"these studies demonstrate that xenopus laevis oocytes possess a monocarboxylate transport system that shares some functional features with the members of the mammalian monocarboxylate cotransporters family, but, in the meanwhile, exhibits some particular properties, mainly concerning cation specificity."
31,8075126L0,8075126,secretory granules from the rat pancreas contain electrolyte transport pathways that may contribute to exocrine fluid production.
32,8075126L1,8075126,the cl  selective transport pathway was measured indirectly in isolated granules by ionophore induced lysis after suspension in isotonic kcl.
33,8075126L2,8075126,this cl  transport was shown to respond to alterations in the granule membrane lipid environment.
34,8075126L3,8075126,exogenously added phospholipase a2 (pla2) caused an increase of up to 193% in the cl  specific transport by the isolated granules.
35,8075126L4,8075126,"in addition, the products of pla2 hydrolysis, lysophospholipids and unesterified fatty acids, directly increased the rate of cl  transport when incubated with granules in vitro."
36,8075126L5,8075126,lysophospholipids (2.0 micrograms/ml) increased the cl  transport between 280 450% (depending on the lysophospholipid species).
37,8075126L6,8075126,"similarly, free fatty acids (10 microm) increased the granule cl  transport from 25% with capric acid (10:0) to 255% with arachidonic acid (20:4)."
38,8075126L7,8075126,"the relative extent of stimulation by fatty acids was dependent on their carbon chain length and to a lesser extent, the degree of unsaturation."
39,8075126L8,8075126,"the inhibition (68%) of pla2 promoted granule lysis by 4 acetamido 4' isothiocyanatostilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid (0.5 mm) also suggests that the effect is specific for the granule cl  channel."
40,8075126L9,8075126,"thus, the data show that zymogen granule cl  transport is influenced by membrane lipids and supports a role for pla2 in controlling electrolyte transport during stimulus secretion coupling."
41,16521701L0,16521701,eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) has been shown to exert anti inflammatory actions.
42,16521701L1,16521701,"to evaluate the effects of epa on chronic hepatitis c, we administered epa ethyl ester capsules to patients receiving the combination therapy of interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin."

45,16521701L4,16521701,"blood samples were obtained before and after 4, 8, 12 and 24 wk of therapy and analyzed for fatty acid compositions of erythrocyte and plasma and serum 8 hydroxy 2' deoxyguanosine."
46,16521701L5,16521701,"epa in erythrocyte membrane rose to 3 fold the basal level in the epa group, while it decreased significantly in the control group after 24 wk of therapy."
47,16521701L6,16521701,"lymphocyte counts in the epa group increased to 120.8 +/  25.4% after 4 wk of therapy and maintained the basal level throughout therapy, whereas the counts decreased significantly in controls."
48,16521701L7,16521701,the serum alanine aminotransferase level was improved significantly in the epa group.
49,16521701L8,16521701,changes in lymphocyte counts following 24 wk of therapy correlated with the epa level in erythrocyte.
50,16521701L9,16521701,the serum 8 hydroxy 2' deoxyguanosine level at 24 wk in the epa group was significantly lower than that in controls.
51,16521701L10,16521701,these observations may suggest the beneficial effect of epa supplementation in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c patients.
52,12923198L0,12923198,"age related macular degeneration (amd) is a slow, progressive disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors."
53,12923198L1,12923198,free radical induced oxidation of docosahexaenoate (dha) containing lipids generates omega (2 carboxyethyl)pyrrole (cep) protein adducts that are more abundant in ocular tissues from amd than normal human donors.
54,12923198L2,12923198,"to understand better the role of oxidative damage in amd, we have synthesized cep modified proteins, produced anti cep antibodies, and initiated analysis of cep immunoreactivity and autoantibodies in human plasma."
55,12923198L3,12923198,"a highly selective rabbit polyclonal anti cep antibody was raised that binds cep 1000 times more strongly than carboxypropylpyrrole, a close structural analogue."
56,12923198L4,12923198,the cep adduct uniquely indicates oxidative modification from dha derivatives because cep protein modifications cannot arise from any other common polyunsaturated fatty acid.
57,12923198L5,12923198,immunocytochemistry localized cep to photoreceptor rod outer segments and retinal pigment epithelium in mouse retina and demonstrated more intense cep immunoreactivity in photoreceptors from a human amd donor compared with healthy human retina.
58,12923198L6,12923198,the mean level of anti cep immunoreactivity in amd human plasma (n = 19 donors) was 1.5 fold higher (p = 0.004) than in age matched controls (n = 19 donors).
59,12923198L7,12923198,sera from amd patients demonstrated mean titers of anti cep autoantibody 2.3 fold higher than controls (p = 0.02).
60,12923198L8,12923198,"of individuals (n = 13) exhibiting both antigen and autoantibody levels above the mean for non amd controls, 92% had amd."
61,12923198L9,12923198,these results suggest that together cep immunoreactivity and autoantibody titer may have diagnostic utility in predicting amd susceptibility.
62,9895229L0,9895229,metabolic abnormalities observed in retina and in cerebral cortex were compared in diabetic rats and experimentally galactosemic rats.
63,9895229L1,9895229,"diabetes or experimental galactosemia of 2 months duration significantly increased oxidative stress in retina, as shown by elevation of retinal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbars) and subnormal activities of antioxidant defense enzymes, but had no such effect in the cerebral cortex."
64,9895229L2,9895229,"activities of sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase [(na,k) atpase] and calcium atpase became subnormal in retina as well as in cerebral cortex."
65,9895229L3,9895229,"in contrast, protein kinase c (pkc) activity was elevated in retina but not in cerebral cortex in the same hyperglycemic rats."
66,9895229L4,9895229,"dietary supplementation with an antioxidant mixture (containing ascorbic acid, trolox, alpha tocopherol acetate, n acetyl cysteine, beta carotene, and selenium) prevented the diabetes induced and galactosemia induced elevation of retinal oxidative stress, the elevation of retinal pkc activity and the decrease of retinal atpases."
67,9895229L5,9895229,"in cerebral cortex, administration of the antioxidant diet also prevented the diabetes induced decreases in (na,k) atpase and calcium atpases, but had no effect on tbars and activities of pkc and antioxidant defense enzymes."
68,9895229L6,9895229,"the results indicate that retina and cerebral cortex differ distinctly in their response to elevation of tissue hexose, and that cerebral cortex is more resistant than retina to diabetes induced oxidative stress."
69,9895229L7,9895229,"the greater resistance to oxidative stress in cerebral cortex, as compared to retina, is consistent with the resistance of cerebral cortex to microvascular disease in diabetes, and with a hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to microvascular disease in diabetes."
70,9895229L8,9895229,dietary supplementation with these antioxidants offers a means to inhibit multiple hyperglycemia induced retinal metabolic abnormalities.
71,6261530L0,6261530,polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other inflammatory cells on exposure to appropriate stimuli release superoxide anion radical into the extracellular space.
72,6261530L1,6261530,"this results in the further generation of other activated oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen."

75,6261530L4,6261530,increased microvascular permeability and increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte endothelial adhesion were also observed.
76,6261530L5,6261530,the results suggest that a variety of alterations to macromolecular and cellular elements of tissues can be mediated by specific free radical species.
77,6261530L6,6261530,similar mechanisms may play a role in the structural and cellular injury occurring in the microcirculation during inflammation and other disease processes.
78,27762305L0,27762305,osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk.
79,27762305L1,27762305,the majority of oi cases have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are usually caused by mutations in genes encoding type i collagen.
80,27762305L2,27762305,"oi cases of autosomal recessive inheritance are rare, and oi type xi is attributable to mutation of the fkbp10 gene."
81,27762305L3,27762305,"here, we used next generation sequencing and sanger sequencing to detect mutations in fkbp10 and to analyze their relation to the phenotypes of oi type xi in three chinese patients."
82,27762305L4,27762305,we also evaluated the efficacy of zoledronic acid treatment in these patients.
83,27762305L5,27762305,"two of the affected patients had novel compound heterozygous mutations, one patient with c.343c>t (p.r115x) in exon 2 and c.1085delc (p.a362fsx1) in exon 7, and the other patient with c.879c>g (p.y293x) in exon 5 and c.918 3c>g in intron 5. in the third proband, we identified a homozygous single base pair duplication, c.831dupc (p.g278rfsx95) in exon 5. in conclusion, we report for the first time that these novel pathogenic mutations of fkbp10 can lead to the extremely rare type xi oi without contractures, which expands the genotypic spectrum of oi."
84,27762305L6,27762305,"the phenotypes of these patients are similar to patients with types iii or iv oi, and zoledronic acid is effective in increasing bmd, inhibiting bone resorption biomarkers and reducing fractures of these patients."

93,3360755L8,3360755,the content of the enzyme in microsomes was about 1.5% of total microsomal protein.
94,3360755L9,3360755,"it was exclusively located on the luminal side of microsomes, and was not detected immunologically in golgi fractions or serum."
95,3360755L10,3360755,"in vitro translation of rat liver rna by reticulocyte lysate showed that carboxyesterase e1 was synthesized preferentially on the bound ribosomes, as a precursor peptide larger than the peptide of the mature enzyme."
96,3360755L11,3360755,carboxyesterase e1 was solubilized from microsomes by treatment with low concentrations of detergents.
97,3360755L12,3360755,"however, it was not released from microsomes by treatment with a synthetic peptide which made the microsomal membrane permeable to soluble protein molecules."

99,9013956L0,9013956,the bop gene (for cd8b opposite) is located immediately upstream of the mouse cd8b gene.
100,9013956L1,9013956,expression of bop gene transcripts was previously observed in several long term ctl lines and in thymus.
101,9013956L2,9013956,"the present studies demonstrate that expression of the bop gene in lymphocytes appears to be confined to cd8 positive cells, and that bop gene expression is inducible by con a. they further show that a single bop gene encodes protein products with distinct amino terminal sequences that are expressed in ctls (t bop) and in cardiac and skeletal muscle (skm bop), as well as what appears to be a noncoding cdna (t ncb) expressed only in ctls."
102,9013956L3,9013956,"the t bop and t ncb cdnas in ctls result from alternative splicing of a single primary transcript, whereas the bop transcripts expressed in ctls and in muscle appear to be transcribed from different promoters."
103,9013956L4,9013956,the bop proteins expressed in ctls and muscle contain zinc finger like motifs with homology to those of the eto/mtg8 proto oncogene and several other proteins of interest.
104,9013956L5,9013956,western blot analysis with a hamster anti bop mab have detected the bop protein in muscle cells and in cos 7 cells transfected with bop cdna constructs.
105,19317493L0,19317493,assembling protein complexes and protein interaction networks from affinity purification based proteomics data sets remains a challenge.
106,19317493L1,19317493,"when little a priori knowledge of the complexes exists, it is difficult to place proteins in the proper locations and evaluate the results of clustering approaches."
107,19317493L2,19317493,here we have systematically compared multiple hierarchical and partitioning clustering approaches using a well characterized but highly complex human protein interaction network data set centered around the conserved aaa+ atpases tip49a and tip49b.
108,19317493L3,19317493,"this network provides a challenge to clustering algorithms because tip49a and tip49b are present in four distinct complexes, the network contains modules, and the network has multiple attachments."
109,19317493L4,19317493,"we compared the use of binary data, quantitative proteomics data in the form of normalized spectral abundance factors, and the z score normalization."
110,19317493L5,19317493,"in our analysis, a partitioning approach indicated the major modules in a network."
111,19317493L6,19317493,"next, while euclidian distance was sensitive to scaling, with data transformation, all the attachments in a data set were recovered in one branch of a dendrogram."
112,19317493L7,19317493,"finally, when pearson correlation and hierarchical clustering were used, complexes were well separated and their attachments were placed in the proper locations."
113,19317493L8,19317493,each of these three approaches provided distinct information useful for assembly of a network of multiple protein complexes.
114,1558948L0,1558948,"a full length tomato cdna clone, tsw12, which is developmentally and environmentally regulated, has been isolated and characterized."
115,1558948L1,1558948,tsw12 mrna is accumulated during tomato seed germination and its level increases after nacl treatment or heat shock.
116,1558948L2,1558948,"in mature plants, tsw12 mrna is only detected upon treatment with nacl, mannitol or aba and its expression mainly occurs in stems."
117,1558948L3,1558948,the nucleotide sequence of tsw12 includes an open reading frame coding for a basic protein of 114 amino acids; the first 23 amino acids exhibit the sequence characteristic of a signal peptide.
118,1558948L4,1558948,the high similarity between the tsw12 deduced amino acid sequence and reported lipid transfer proteins suggests that tsw12 encodes a lipid transfer protein.
119,16028633L0,16028633,there is limited information on the absorption of selenium from different foods in humans because of technical difficulties associated with isotopic labeling of dietary selenium.
120,16028633L1,16028633,"wheat, garlic, and cod fish were intrinsically labeled with se 77 or se 82 stable isotopes."
121,16028633L2,16028633,"labeled meals were fed in random order to 14 adults, with a minimum washout period of six weeks between each test meal."
122,16028633L3,16028633,apparent absorption was measured as luminal loss using a fecal monitoring technique over an 8 day period.
123,16028633L4,16028633,"plasma appearance of the isotope was measured at 7, 24, and 48 hours post ingestion."

125,16028633L6,16028633,"lowest plasma concentration was observed after the fish meal at all three time points, with a peak at 24 hours, whereas wheat produced the highest plasma concentration at all three time points and peaked at 7 hours."
126,16028633L7,16028633,"selenium absorption from wheat and garlic was higher than from fish, and inter individual variation was low."
127,16028633L8,16028633,form of selenium and food constituents appear to be key determinants of post absorptive metabolism.
128,8245124L0,8245124,excitation contraction (e c) coupling is thought to involve close interactions between the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor; ryr) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) and the dihydropyridine receptor (dhpr) alpha 1 subunit in the t tubule membrane.
129,8245124L1,8245124,"triadin, a 95 kd protein isolated from heavy sr, binds both the ryr and dhpr and may thus participate in e c coupling or in interactions responsible for the formation of sr/t tubule junctions."
130,8245124L2,8245124,immunofluorescence labeling of normal mouse myotubes shows that the ryr and triadin co aggregate with the dhpr in punctate clusters upon formation of functional junctions.
131,8245124L3,8245124,"dysgenic myotubes with a deficiency in the alpha 1 subunit of the dhpr show reduced expression and clustering of ryr and triadin; however, both proteins are still capable of forming clusters and attaining mature cross striated distributions."
132,8245124L4,8245124,"thus, the molecular organization of the ryr and triadin in the terminal cisternae of sr as well as its association with the t tubules are independent of interactions with the dhpr alpha 1 subunit."
133,8245124L5,8245124,"analysis of calcium transients in dysgenic myotubes with fluorescent calcium indicators reveals spontaneous and caffeine induced calcium release from intracellular stores similar to those of normal muscle; however, depolarization induced calcium release is absent."
134,8245124L6,8245124,"thus, characteristic calcium release properties of the ryr do not require interactions with the dhpr; neither do they require the normal organization of the ryr in the terminal sr cisternae."
135,8245124L7,8245124,"in hybrids of dysgenic myotubes fused with normal cells, both action potential induced calcium transients and the normal clustered organization of the ryr are restored in regions expressing the dhpr alpha 1 subunit."
136,568121L0,568121,extracts prepared from several lines of transformed cells were examined for the presence of cellular binding proteins specific for retinoids.
137,568121L1,568121,"extracts of human retinoblastoma cell line weri rb1 contained a cellular binding protein specific for retinoic acid, whereas extracts of human retinoblastoma cell line y 79 contained cellular binding proteins for both retinol and retinoic acid."
138,568121L2,568121,"upon purification, the latter two binding proteins proved to have properties similar to those of the corresponding proteins obtained from bovine retina."
139,568121L3,568121,smaller amounts of these binding proteins were detected in extracts of undifferentiated and differentiated neuroblastoma and mccoy cells.
140,568121L4,568121,hela and rat glioma cells had no detectable amount of binding proteins.

142,8223341L0,8223341,"gene regulation by steroid hormones is mediated by binding of the hormone ligand to the corresponding receptor that triggers a complex set of interactions of the hormone receptors with each other, with dna in chromatin, and with a variety of other proteins."
143,8223341L1,8223341,in this review we attempt to summarize what is known about these interactions using as the main example the regulation of mouse mammary tumor virus transcription by glucocorticoids and progestins.
144,8223341L2,8223341,"we describe in some detail the interaction of monomers and homodimers of the steroid receptors with their recognition sequences, and the molecular mechanism used to discriminate between the responsive elements for glucocorticoids/progestins and estrogens."

147,8223341L5,8223341,"in addition to ligand binding, these include receptor phosphorylation, changes in dna topology, and the organization of dna in nucleosomes."
148,8223341L6,8223341,from this overview we draw the tentative conclusion that the specificity of the hormonal response in different cells results from a combination of developmental restrictions both in the accessibility of genomic sequence and in the repertoire of regulatory proteins present in each particular cell.
149,8223341L7,8223341,"in addition, the array of regulatory sequences in dna and chromatin determines the precise nature of macromolecular interactions of the receptors that are modulated by their degree of phosphorylation."
150,10865835L0,10865835,the process of plaque destabilization and rupture remains an area of intense investigation.
151,10865835L1,10865835,"while reductions in lumen cross sectional area induced by early, non occlusive lesions are compensated by remodeling and expansion of the artery, further plaque enlargement leads to an uncompensated reduction in lumen area and an increase in surface shearing forces."
152,10865835L2,10865835,we hypothesize that these local increases in wall shear stress lead to a reduction in smooth muscle cell proliferation and increase in cell death.
153,10865835L3,10865835,"using a primate prosthetic graft model, we have observed that alterations in nitric oxide and platelet derived growth factor metabolism are important regulators of intimal growth and regression."

167,20923416L8,20923416,these structures and the wealth of biochemical data on the activity control of betp in response to osmotic stress enable a correlation between the sensing of osmotic stress by a transporter protein with the ensuing regulation of transport activity.
168,20923416L9,20923416,"molecular determinants governing the high affinity binding of the compatible solutes by betp and cait, the coupling in symporters and antiporters, and the osmoregulatory properties are discussed in detail for betp and various bcct carriers."

222,9632776L5,9632776,"as we report here, aml1 also synergizes, and interacts physically, with pu."
223,9632776L6,9632776,1. detailed analysis of the physical and functional interaction of aml1 with pu.1 and c/ebpalpha has revealed that the proteins contact one another through their dna binding domains and that aml1 exhibits cooperative dna binding with c/ebpalpha but not with pu.1.
224,9632776L7,9632776,"this difference in dna binding abilities may explain, in part, the differences observed in synergistic activation."
225,9632776L8,9632776,"furthermore, the activation domains of all three factors are required for synergistic activation, and the region of aml1 required for synergy with pu.1 is distinct from that required for synergy with c/ebpalpha."

267,14521879L5,14521879,deletion analysis located the blf binding domain to a 200 amino acid region at the amino terminus of lbp.
268,14521879L6,14521879,analysis of the primary and secondary structure suggested that lbp is an m like protein.
269,14521879L7,14521879,an isogenic mutant of s. uberis lacking the internal sequence of the lbp gene was constructed by allele replacement.

526,28806418L10,28806418,the difference in mean dds between dry and rainy seasons was mainly due to the difference in the consumption of vitamin a rich fruits and vegetables between the seasons.

538,19754887L0,19754887,"rapid to moderately rapid changes in intracellular ca2+ concentration, or ca2+ signals, control a variety of critical cellular functions in the immune system."
539,19754887L1,19754887,these signals are comprised of ca2+ release from intracellular stores coordinated with ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane.
540,19754887L2,19754887,"the most common mechanisms by which these two modes of signaling occur is through inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (ip3) induced release of ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and store operated ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane."
541,19754887L3,19754887,"the latter process was postulated over 20 years ago, and in just the past few years, the key molecular players have been discovered: stim proteins serve as sensors of ca2+ within the er which communicate with and activate plasma membrane store operated channels composed of orai subunits."
542,19754887L4,19754887,the process of store operated ca2+ entry provides support for oscillating ca2+ signals from the er and also provides direct activator ca2+ that signals to a variety of downstream effectors.
543,9551922L0,9551922,all clinical isolates of streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) share the ability to resist phagocytosis and grow in human blood.
544,9551922L1,9551922,"in many strains, this property is due to the expression of a single antiphagocytic m protein, while other strains express more than one m like molecule, of which the role in phagocytosis resistance is unclear."
545,9551922L2,9551922,"in particular, all s. pyogenes strains of the of+ lineage, representing approximately half of all isolates, express two m like proteins, mrp and emm, which are immunologically unrelated."
546,9551922L3,9551922,these two proteins bind different ligands that have been implicated in phagocytosis resistance: mrp binds fibrinogen and emm binds the complement inhibitor c4bp.
547,9551922L4,9551922,"using a clinical isolate of the common serotype 22, we created mutants affected in the mrp and emm genes and characterized them in phagocytosis experiments and by electron microscopy."

549,9551922L6,9551922,"however, optimal growth required the expression of both mrp and emm."
550,9551922L7,9551922,"experiments in which coagulation was inhibited using the specific thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, rather than heparin, indicated that emm is more important than mrp for resistance to phagocytosis."
551,9551922L8,9551922,"tuftlike surface structures typical for s. pyogenes were still present in the mrp emm  double mutant, but not in a mutant affected in the regulatory gene mga, indicating that the presence of these surface structures is not directly correlated to phagocytosis resistance."

556,17297093L3,17297093,total white blood cells were used to determine the oxidative status of glutathione.
557,17297093L4,17297093,peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) lysates were used to determine the total antioxidant potential and enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and thioredoxin reductase (trxr1).
558,17297093L5,17297093,both plasma lipid hydroperoxide concentrations and gpx activity in pbmc increased at calving and during the first 21 dim when compared with prepartum samples.
559,17297093L6,17297093,"conversely, the total antioxidant potential and trxr activity declined in pbmc during the first 21 dim, even though both gpx activity and the glutathione to gssg ratio remained elevated during this time period."
560,17297093L7,17297093,"results from this study support previous findings that report increased gpx activity when reactive oxygen metabolites, including lipid hydroperoxides, increase in transition dairy cows."
561,17297093L8,17297093,"the significant decrease in trxr activity with a concomitant decrease in total antioxidant potential in pbmc during this same stage of lactation, however, would suggest that this selenoprotein is not able to rebound during periods of oxidative stress to the same extent as gpx1."
562,17297093L9,17297093,this study shows for the first time that trxr may be an important antioxidant defense mechanism in pbmc that is compromised during the periparturient period.

568,9842893L5,9842893,"the two clones carry both kappa and lambda light chains productively rearranged, but fail to express the x chain on the cell surface due to a stop codon acquired by somatic mutation."
569,9842893L6,9842893,"interestingly, the analysis of the extent of somatic mutations accumulated by the two light chains might suggest that the lambda chain could have been acquired through a secondary rearrangement."
570,9842893L7,9842893,"taken together, these data suggest that secondary ig gene rearrangements leading to replacement may occur in human gc and may contribute to the peripheral b cell repertoire."

576,3771545L5,3771545,low oxidase activity toward several xenobiotic substrates and selectivity toward endogenous sterol substrates is observed for the purified cytochrome.

587,8349035L4,8349035,thromboxane a2 synthesis inhibition with oky 046 (10( 5) m) did not affect the acetylcholine induced relaxation in both control and diabetic rats.
588,8349035L5,8349035,"in aortic rings under resting tension, acetylcholine induced a contraction that was greater in diabetic than control rats, when the nitric oxide production was inhibited by ng nitro l arginine methylester (10( 4) m)."
589,8349035L6,8349035,this acetylcholine induced contraction was observed only in the rings with intact endothelium and was completely abolished by ono 3708 (10( 6) m).
590,8349035L7,8349035,the concentration of 6 keto prostaglandin f1 alpha in the solution bathing diabetic rat aortic rings increased significantly after acetylcholine (10( 5) m) administration.
591,8349035L8,8349035,prostacyclin (10( 9) 10( 6) m) did not induce contractions at all.
592,8349035L9,8349035,prostacyclin is unlikely to mediate contractions because of its low contractile potency.

594,15957552L0,15957552,diabetic nephropathy is the main cause of end stage renal damage.
595,15957552L1,15957552,oxidative stress is involved in the etiology of diabetic nephropathy and intracellular calcium is reported to play a considerable role in the development of renal damage in the diabetic kidney.
596,15957552L2,15957552,calcium antagonism can slow the progression of renal impairment in diabetes.
597,15957552L3,15957552,"the present study was thus designed to examine the effect of a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, on renal function, oxidative stress, and nitric oxide (no) release in streptozotocin (stz) induced diabetic rats."
598,15957552L4,15957552,diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of stz (65 mg/kg) in rats.
599,15957552L5,15957552,"after 4 weeks of stz injection, the rats were divided in to four groups: control rats, diabetic rats treated with saline, and two groups of diabetic rats treated with diltiazem (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p, respectively) for 8 weeks starting from 4 weeks after stz injection."
600,15957552L6,15957552,"renal function was assessed by creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance, and urea clearance."
601,15957552L7,15957552,"oxidative stress was measured by renal malondialdehyde (mda), reduced glutathione (gsh), superoxide dismutase (sod), and catalase."
602,15957552L8,15957552,we also measured renal nitrite levels.
603,15957552L9,15957552,"at the end of the 8 weeks, diabetic rats exhibited renal dysfunction as evidenced by reduced creatinine and urea clearance along with enhanced albumin excretion rate as compared with control rats."
604,15957552L10,15957552,"biochemical analysis of kidneys revealed a marked increase in oxidative stress demonstrated by increased lipid peroxidation and decreased activities of key antioxidant enzymes, gsh, sod, and catalase in diabetic rats."
605,15957552L11,15957552,release of no also significantly higher in diabetic rats than controls.
606,15957552L12,15957552,chronic treatment with diltiazem in diabetic rats significantly attenuated both renal dysfunction and oxidative stress along with increased no levels as compared with untreated diabetic rats.
607,15957552L13,15957552,"the kidneys of diabetic rats showed morphological changes such as hyaline casts, glomerular thickening, and moderate interstitial fibrosis and arteriolopathy, whereas diltiazem administration markedly prevented diabetic induced renal morphological alterations."
608,15957552L14,15957552,the present study suggests that oxidative stress/nitrosative stress is increased in the diabetic kidney and calcium channel blockage can prevent these changes.
609,15957552L15,15957552,"the results also suggest that in stz induced diabetic rats, the protective action of diltiazem might be mediated, at least in part, by its effect on tissue oxidant/antioxidant status."
610,12070088L0,12070088,"sensory placodes are ectodermal thickenings that give rise to elements of the vertebrate cranial sensory nervous system, including the inner ear and nose."
611,12070088L1,12070088,"although mutations have been described in humans, mice and zebrafish that perturb ear and nose development, no mutation is known to prevent sensory placode formation."
612,12070088L2,12070088,"thus, it has been postulated that a functional redundancy exists in the genetic mechanisms that govern sensory placode development."
613,12070088L3,12070088,"we describe a zebrafish deletion mutation, b380, which results in a lack of both otic and olfactory placodes."
614,12070088L4,12070088,"the b380 deletion removes several known genes and expressed sequence tags, including dlx3 and dlx7, two transcription factors that share a homoeobox domain similar in sequence to the drosophila distal less gene."
615,12070088L5,12070088,dlx3 and dlx7 are expressed in an overlapping pattern in the regions that produce the otic and olfactory placodes in zebrafish.
616,12070088L6,12070088,we present evidence suggesting that it is specifically the removal of these two genes that leads to the otic and olfactory phenotype of b380 mutants.
617,12070088L7,12070088,"using morpholinos, antisense oligonucleotides that effectively block translation of target genes, we find that functional reduction of both dlx genes contributes to placode loss."
618,12070088L8,12070088,"expression patterns of the otic marker pax2.1, olfactory marker anxv and eya1, a marker of both placodes, in morpholino injected embryos recapitulate the reduced expression of these genes seen in b380 mutants."
619,12070088L9,12070088,we also examine expression of dlx3 and dlx7 in the morpholino injected embryos and present evidence for existence of auto  and cross regulatory control of expression among these genes.
620,12070088L10,12070088,we demonstrate that dlx3 is necessary and sufficient for proper otic and olfactory placode development.
621,12070088L11,12070088,"however, our results indicate that dlx3 and dlx7 act in concert and their importance in placode formation is only revealed by inactivating both paralogs."

630,26845734L0,26845734,the photodynamic therapy of cancer is contingent upon the sustained generation of singlet oxygen in the tumor region.
631,26845734L1,26845734,"however, tumors of the most metastatic cancer types develop a region of severe hypoxia, which puts them beyond the reach of most therapeutic protocols."
632,26845734L2,26845734,"more troublesome, photodynamic action generates acute hypoxia as the process itself diminishes cellular oxygen reserves, which makes it a self limiting method."
633,26845734L3,26845734,"herein, we describe a new concept that could eventually lead to a change in the 100 year old paradigm of photodynamic therapy and potentially offer solutions to some of the lingering problems."

638,16299515L2,16299515,"here, we introduce a series of consecutive polyalanines into different regions of the tape measure to monitor the formation of compact structure in the nascent peptide."
639,16299515L3,16299515,we find that the formation of compact structure of the polyalanine sequence depends on its location.
640,16299515L4,16299515,calculation of free energies for the equilibria between folded and unfolded nascent peptides in different regions of the tunnel shows that there are zones of secondary structure formation inside the ribosomal exit tunnel.
641,16299515L5,16299515,these zones may have an active role in nascent chain compaction.
642,28335733L0,28335733,the normobaric oxygen paradox states that a short exposure to normobaric hyperoxia followed by rapid return to normoxia creates a condition of 'relative hypoxia' which stimulates erythropoietin (epo) production.
643,28335733L1,28335733,alterations in glutathione and reactive oxygen species (ros) may be involved in this process.
644,28335733L2,28335733,we tested the effects of short term hyperoxia on epo levels and the microcirculation in critically ill patients.

652,3016662L1,3016662,we have cloned and expressed the repe gene in an inducible atg fusion vector and have detected specific binding of e protein to the repe operator and to four 19 base pair direct repeats (incb) within the f plasmid replication origin ori2.
653,3016662L2,3016662,"binding of e protein at the repe operator occurs with higher affinity than at ori2(incb) and gives almost complete protection to at least 30 base pairs, whereas binding of e protein to the direct repeats in the ori2 region shows an alternating pattern of enhanced and reduced sensitivity to dnaase cleavage consistent with a protein induced folding of the dna."
654,3016662L3,3016662,these results provide direct biochemical support for a model of f plasmid replication in which the e protein serves both as an initiator of replication and as an autorepressor of its own synthesis.

670,8707887L8,8707887,"in probing osteoclast like cell rna with the pcr derived inos cdna, a 4.8 kb mrna species was detected whose levels were greatly increased by lps."
671,8707887L9,8707887,"induction of inos mrna by lps, or by proinflammatory cytokines, occurred prior to the rise of medium nitrite in time course studies and was diminished by dexamethasone."
672,8707887L10,8707887,"moreover, osteoclast like cells demonstrated an upregulation of no production and inos mrna by il 8 and il 10, regulatory mechanism's not previously described."
673,8707887L11,8707887,"it is concluded that osteoclast like cells express a novel inos that is upregulated by inflammatory mediators, leading to no production."
674,8707887L12,8707887,"therefore, no may serve as both a paracrine and autocrine signal for modulating osteoclast bone resorption."
675,14730019L0,14730019,the exon junction complex (ejc) is a protein complex that assembles near exon exon junctions of mrnas as a result of splicing.
676,14730019L1,14730019,"ejc proteins play important roles in postsplicing events including mrna export, cytoplasmic localization, and nonsense mediated decay."
677,14730019L2,14730019,recent evidence suggests that mrna translation is also influenced by the splicing history of the transcript.
678,14730019L3,14730019,"here we identify eif4a3, a dead box rna helicase and a member of the eif4a family of translation initiation factors, as a novel component of the ejc."
679,14730019L4,14730019,we show that eif4a3 associates preferentially with nuclear complexes containing the ejc proteins magoh and y14.
680,14730019L5,14730019,"furthermore, eif4a3, but not the highly related eif4a1 or eif4a2, preferentially associates with spliced mrna."
681,14730019L6,14730019,in vitro splicing and mapping experiments demonstrate that eif4a3 binds mrnas at the position of the ejc.
682,14730019L7,14730019,"using monoclonal antibodies, we show that eif4a3 is found in the nucleus whereas eif4a1 and eif4a2 are found in the cytoplasm."
683,14730019L8,14730019,"thus, eif4a3 likely provides a splicing dependent influence on the translation of mrnas."
684,12941297L0,12941297,"the dipolar relaxation process induced by the excitation of the single tryptophan residue of four proteins (staphylococcal nuclease, ribonuclease t1, phosphofructokinase, and superoxide dismutase) has been studied by dynamic fluorescence measurements."
685,12941297L1,12941297,a new algorithm taking into account the relaxation effect has been applied to the fluorescence decay function obtained by phase shift and demodulation data.
686,12941297L2,12941297,"this approach only requires that fluorescence be collected through the whole emission spectrum, avoiding the time consuming determination of the data at different emission wavelengths, as usual with time resolved emission spectroscopy."
687,12941297L3,12941297,"the results nicely match those reported in the literature for staphylococcal nuclease and ribonuclease t1, demonstrating the validity of the model."
688,12941297L4,12941297,"furthermore, this new methodology provides an alternative explanation for the complex decay of phosphofructokinase and human superoxide dismutase suggesting the presence of a relaxation process even in proteins that lack a lifetime dependent spectral shift."
689,12941297L5,12941297,"these findings may have important implications on the analysis of small scale protein dynamics, since dielectric relaxation directly probes a local structural change around the excited state of tryptophan."

691,8972197L1,8972197,since many examples of apoptosis have been reported to involve ap 1 and/or the ap 1 activation pathway.
692,8972197L2,8972197,"since many examples of apoptosis have been reported to involve ap 1 and/or the ap 1 activating enzyme jun kinase (jnk), downstream effectors of ras or ras like small gtp binding proteins, we evaluated the role of these molecules in fas mediated apoptosis."
693,8972197L3,8972197,"although cross linking of fas on jurkat t cells did result in jnk activation, increased activity was observed relatively late, being detectable only after 60 min of stimulation."
694,8972197L4,8972197,expression of a dominant negative form of sek1 that blocked fas mediated induction of jnk activity had no effect on fas mediated apoptosis.
695,8972197L5,8972197,"furthermore, maximally effective concentrations of anti fas did not cause jnk activation if apoptosis was blocked by a cysteine protease inhibitor, suggesting that under these conditions, activation of jnk may be secondary to the stress of apoptosis rather than a direct result of fas engagement."
696,8972197L6,8972197,"despite the activation of jnk, there was no induction of ap 1 activity as determined by gel shift assay or induction of an ap 1 responsive reporter."
697,8972197L7,8972197,"the lack of a requirement for ap 1 induction in fas mediated death was further substantiated with jurkat cells that were stably transfected with a dominant negative cjun, tam 67. while tam 67 effectively prevented ap 1 dependent transcription of both the interleukin 2 and cjun genes, it had no effect on fas induced cell death, even at limiting levels of fas signaling."
698,8972197L8,8972197,"thus, induction of jnk activity in jurkat cells by ligation of fas at levels sufficient to cause cell death is likely a result, rather than a cause, of the apoptotic response, and ap 1 function is not required for fas induced apoptosis."

703,11479704L4,11479704,the inability of a moba mutant to synthesise molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide is confirmed by analysis of cell extracts of the moba strain for molybdenum cofactor forms following iodine oxidation.
704,11479704L5,11479704,"mutations in mobb and mobc are not impaired for molybdoenzyme activities and accumulate wild type levels of molybdopterin and molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide, indicating they are not compromised in molybdenum cofactor synthesis."
705,11479704L6,11479704,"in the moba mutant strain, the inactive dmso reductase is found in the periplasm, suggesting that molybdenum cofactor insertion is not necessarily a pre requisite for export."

707,2162375L1,2162375,"activity of the two key enzymes involved in the synthesis of melatonin, n acetyltransferase (nat) and hydroxyindole o methyltransferase (hiomt), are present in retinoblastoma cells."
708,2162375L2,2162375,the activity of these enzymes and the resulting synthesis and release of melatonin are modulated by the addition of a cyclic amp analogue and butyrate to the culture medium.
709,2162375L3,2162375,"melatonin levels increase dramatically over control levels after the addition of dibutyryl cyclic amp (dbcamp), whereas melatonin levels decrease after butyrate treatment."
710,2162375L4,2162375,"hiomt activity is inhibited by both dbcamp and butyrate, and nat activity is stimulated by both of these differentiating agents, suggesting that the rise in melatonin levels in response to dbcamp is the result of increased activity of nat, whereas the decline in melatonin levels in response to butyrate may be due to a drop in hiomt activity."
711,2162375L5,2162375,"melatonin synthesis is dose  and time dependent, and the effect of dbcamp is readily reversible, whereas the effect of butyrate does not appear to be reversible."
712,2162375L6,2162375,these effects probably reflect basic differences in the regulatory mechanisms of the inducing agents.

719,25311422L5,25311422,6 mp loaded cms ss oha exhibited greater cytotoxicity against hct 116 cells than nih 3t3 cells due to the enhanced cell uptake behavior of cms ss oha.

747,16449187L1,16449187,"bub2 and bfa1 are found on both duplicated spindle pole bodies until anaphase onset, when they disappear from the mother bound spindle pole under unperturbed conditions."

808,15976342L3,15976342,these results suggest that loss of control of cell cycle checkpoints is a common occurrence in lung cancer and support the idea that functional cooperation between different cell cycle regulatory proteins constitutes another level of regulation in cell growth control and tumour suppression.

876,3147215L7,3147215,these population sizes are unrealistic; the fact that different locus pairs yield disparate estimates within the same population argues against the likelihood that the disequilibria may have arisen as a consequence of population bottlenecks.

984,18585814L2,18585814,the physicochemical and biomedical properties of the novel dmc based polymers were evaluated for their application as non viral gene delivery vectors and compared with analogs lacking the disulfide moieties.
985,18585814L3,18585814,"dmc based ss paas show high buffer capacities in the ph range ph 5.1 7.4, a property that may favorably contribute to the endosomal escape of the polyplexes."

991,6203892L0,6203892,"in developing a reliable in vitro system for translocating bacterial proteins, we found that the least dense subfraction of the membrane of escherichia coli was superior to the total inner membrane, both for a secreted protein (alkaline phosphatase) and for an outer membrane protein (ompa)."
992,6203892L1,6203892,"compounds that eliminated the proton motive force inhibited translocation, as already observed in cells; since protein synthesis continued, the energy for translocation appears to be derived from the energized membrane and not simply from atp."
993,6203892L2,6203892,"treatment of the vesicles with protease, under conditions that did not interfere with subsequent protein synthesis, also inactivated them for subsequent translocation."
994,6203892L3,6203892,we conclude that export of some proteins requires protein containing machinery in the cytoplasmic membrane that derives energy from the proton motive force.

999,10779345L4,10779345,"this control is represented by ser64 phosphorylation, which depends on the phosphorylation of all three tp sites."
1000,10779345L5,10779345,the five sites have different influences on the electrophoretic properties of phas i and on the affinity of phas i for eukaryotic initiation factor 4e (eif4e).
1001,10779345L6,10779345,phosphorylation of thr45 or ser64 results in the most dramatic decreases in eif4e binding in vitro.
1002,10779345L7,10779345,"however, each of the sites influences mrna translation, either directly by modulating the binding affinity of phas i and eif4e or indirectly by affecting the phosphorylation of other sites."

1010,26240319L0,26240319,faithful genome duplication and inheritance require the complete resolution of all intertwines within the parental dna duplex.
1011,26240319L1,26240319,this is achieved by topoisomerase action ahead of the replication fork or by fork rotation and subsequent resolution of the dna precatenation formed.
1012,26240319L2,26240319,"although fork rotation predominates at replication termination, in vitro studies have suggested that it also occurs frequently during elongation."

1015,26240319L5,26240319,"we find that fork rotation and precatenation preferentially occur in contexts that inhibit topoisomerase action ahead of the fork, including stable protein dna fragile sites and termination."
1016,26240319L6,26240319,"however, generally, fork rotation and precatenation are actively inhibited by timeless/tof1 and tipin/csm3."
1017,26240319L7,26240319,"in the absence of tof1/timeless, excessive fork rotation and precatenation cause extensive dna damage following dna replication."
1018,26240319L8,26240319,"with tof1, damage related to precatenation is focused on the fragile protein dna sites where fork rotation is induced."

1204,4138889L7,4138889,total fixative osmolality had a marked effect on cell volume with oso(4) but little or no effect with ga or ga oso(4).
1205,4138889L8,4138889,"osmolality of the buffer had a marked effect on cell volume with oso(4), whereas with ga or ga oso(4) it was only significant at very hypotonic buffer osmolalities."

1207,4138889L10,4138889,"osmolality of the postfixation buffer had little effect on cell volume, and duration of fixation or postfixation treatment had no effect with all fixatives."
1208,4138889L11,4138889,"freezing and thawing or centrifugal stress (up to 100,000 g) had little or no effect on cell volume after all fixatives studied."
1209,4138889L12,4138889,mechanical stress obtained by sonication showed that oso(4) alone produced poor stabilization and that ga fixation alone produced the greatest stabilization.
1210,4138889L13,4138889,the results indicate that rapid membrane permeability changes of eatc follow fixative action.
1211,4138889L14,4138889,"the results are consistent with known greater stabilizing effects of ga on model protein systems since cells were also rendered relatively stable to osmotic stress during fixation, an effect not noted with oso(4)."

1214,15287020L1,15287020,"the sequential, step by step morphological changes in u937 cells that occur during the apoptotic program are largely determined by the activation of a specific class of proteases, the caspases."
1215,15287020L2,15287020,the action of these proteases were followed at the ultrastructural level.
1216,15287020L3,15287020,"from our observations 1) no unique morphological feature exists during apoptosis, even in the same cell type; 2) the extent of the morphological modifications are inducer  and dose dependent; 3) double or triple treatments amplify the morphological modifications with a single inducer, but not the rate of apoptosis; and 4) in the case of double treatment the second inducer has to have a cytoplasmatic target because damage to the cytoplasm occurs before nuclear modifications become visible."
1217,15287020L4,15287020,"these data should facilitate a more objective evaluation of apoptosis in conditions where antiproliferative drugs, like antiblastic or immunosuppressive molecules, are used to monitor the efficiency of treatment."

1222,21998290L4,21998290,oxidative dna damage resulted in dna double strand breaks (dsb) as determined by γh2ax foci that colocalized with 53bp1.
1223,21998290L5,21998290,"upon chronic treatment with artesunate, the level of dsb continuously increased over the treatment period up to a steady state level, which is in contrast to ionizing radiation that induced a burst of dsb followed by a decline due to their repair."
1224,21998290L6,21998290,knockdown of rad51 by short interfering rna and inactivation of dna pk strongly sensitized glioma cells to artesunate.
1225,21998290L7,21998290,these data indicate that both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining are involved in the repair of artesunate induced dsb.

1230,21385992L2,21385992,"here, we show that orai1 is regulated by serum  and glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 (sgk1), a growth factor regulated kinase."
1231,21385992L3,21385992,"membrane orai1 protein abundance, i(crac), and soce in human embryonic kidney (hek293) cells stably expressing orai1 and transfected with stim1 were each significantly enhanced by coexpression of constitutively active (s422d)sgk1 (by+81, +378, and+136%, respectively) but not by inactive (k127n)sgk1."
1232,21385992L4,21385992,"coexpression of the ubiquitin ligase nedd4 2, an established negatively regulated sgk1 target, down regulated soce (by  48%) and i(crac) (by  60%), an effect reversed by expression of (s422d)sgk1 (by +175 and +173%, respectively)."

1235,21385992L7,21385992,sgk1 is thus a novel key player in the regulation of soce.

1237,1956696L1,1956696,"in order to evaluate its efficacy in a model closer to man, two different protocols of immunization with recombinant sm28gst were tested on baboons in a large scale trial."
1238,1956696L2,1956696,three injections in the presence of aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant resulted in a significant 38% reduction in the adult worm burden together with a trend for a lower percentage of inflammatory tissue in the liver.
1239,1956696L3,1956696,"individual levels of protection, ranging from 0 to 80%, underlined the heterogeneity of the immune response to this purified molecule in outbred primates."
1240,1956696L4,1956696,"on the other hand, two injections of sm28gst in the presence of aluminium hydroxide and bordetella pertussis reduced female schistosome fecundity by 33%, with a more pronounced effect (66%) on faecal egg output; there was also a trend, in this protocol, for decrease of the mean granuloma surface in the liver."
1241,1956696L5,1956696,"individual anti sm28gst igg antibodies were apparently unrelated to levels of immunity, but there was partial evidence that cytophilic ige might play a role in the immune mechanisms affecting worm viability, but not fecundity."
1242,1956696L6,1956696,"in the mouse model, sm28gst vaccination resulted in a lower hatching ability of tissue eggs recovered from immunized mice whereas passive transfer of specific anti sm28gst t lymphocytes, one day before infection, significantly reduced the number of eggs in the liver of mice."
1243,1956696L7,1956696,"we propose that different protocols of immunization with a recombinant molecule can impede schistosoma mansoni worm viability and fecundity, but can also affect miracidium physiology, with important consequences for disease transmission and granuloma derived pathology."
1244,9436927L0,9436927,the translocation (8;21) is a chromosome abnormality associated with acute myeloid leukemia (aml).
1245,9436927L1,9436927,"as a consequence of the translocation the aml1 (cbfa2) gene in the 21q22 region is fused to the eto(cdr,mtg8) gene in the 8q22 region, resulting in one transcriptionally active gene on the 8q  derivative chromosome."
1246,9436927L2,9436927,in this report we demonstrate the use of a highly specific dual colour fish method for the detection of t(8;21) on interphase cells.
1247,9436927L3,9436927,genomic probes able to detect the chimeric aml1/eto gene on the 8q  derivative chromosome were assayed on both normal and leukemic bone marrow and peripheral blood samples.
1248,9436927L4,9436927,cut off values were established by independent analysis of 15 bone marrow specimens negative for the translocation.
1249,9436927L5,9436927,"the cut off value of positive nuclei was determined to be 2% and the cut off value for both positive nuclei and nuclei of uncertain classification, 4%."
1250,9436927L6,9436927,persistence of cells above these cut off values was interpreted as persistence of the mutated clone.
1251,9436927L7,9436927,a total of 36 samples at different disease stages were tested.
1252,9436927L8,9436927,interphase cytogenetics detected the translocation at the onset and relapse in the bm or the pb of 14 aml patients with t(8;21).
1253,9436927L9,9436927,the technique appears to be an alternative tool to both conventional cytogenetics and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt pcr) for the monitoring of disease during patients' follow up.
1254,9436927L10,9436927,"by enabling the analysis of individual cells, interphase fish is ideal for clonality studies both for clinical and experimental applications."
1255,12673362L0,12673362,"labile iron pool (lip) constitutes a crossroad of metabolic pathways of iron containing compounds and is midway between the cellular need for iron, its uptake and storage."
1256,12673362L1,12673362,in this study we investigated oxidative dna damage in relation to the labile iron pool in a pair of mouse lymphoma l5178y (ly) sublines (ly r and ly s) differing in sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide.
1257,12673362L2,12673362,"the ly r cells, which are hydrogen peroxide sensitive, contain 3 times more labile iron than the hydrogen peroxide resistant ly s cells."
1258,12673362L3,12673362,"using the comet assay, we compared total dna breakage in the studied cell lines treated with hydrogen peroxide (25 microm for 30 min at 4 degrees c)."
1259,12673362L4,12673362,more dna damage was found in ly r cells than in ly s cells.
1260,12673362L5,12673362,we also compared the levels of dna lesions sensitive to specific dna repair enzymes in both cell lines treated with h(2)o(2).
1261,12673362L6,12673362,the levels of endonuclease iii sensitive sites and fapy dna glycosylase sensitive sites were found to be higher in ly r cells than in ly s cells.
1262,12673362L7,12673362,"our data suggest that the sensitivity of ly r cells to h(2)o(2) is partially caused by the higher yield of oxidative dna damage, as compared to that in ly s cells."
1263,12673362L8,12673362,the critical factor appears to be the availability of transition metal ions that take part in the oh radical generating fenton reaction (very likely in the form of lip).
1264,7364939L0,7364939,the effect of various diuretics on h+ secretion was studied in the isolated short circuited urinary bladder of the turtle.
1265,7364939L1,7364939,"mucosal (urinary) chlorothiazide stimulated h+ secretion promptly, from 1.33 +/  0.24 to 3.03 +/  0.25 mueq/h (p less than 0.001)."
1266,7364939L2,7364939,"the effect was rapidly reversible upon washout of the drug, h+ returning to control levels, 1.37 +/  0.26 mueq/h (p less than 0.001)."
1267,7364939L3,7364939,similar effects were observed with mucosal hydrochlorothiazide and mucosal ethacrynic acid/cysteine.
1268,7364939L4,7364939,"stimulation of h+ secretion occurred in the presence or the absence of exogenous co2, in the presence or absence of mucosal na+ and during inhibition of na+ transport by ouabain."
1269,7364939L5,7364939,there was no stimulation of h+ secretion by uncomplexed ethacrynic acid or by mucosal furosemide.
1270,7364939L6,7364939,"the nondiuretic sulfonamide, sulfasoxizole, and the nonsulfonamide buffer, borate, had no effect on h+ secretion."
1271,7364939L7,7364939,"these observations indicate that the stimulatory effect of diuretics on h+ secretion is not related to active sodium transport, transepithelial electrical potential, or the buffering capacity of the drugs."
1272,7364939L8,7364939,"since the transepithelial ph gradient at which active h+ secretion was abolished was identical for chlorothiazide treated tissues (2.68 ph u) as for control tissues (2.65 ph u, ns), the data suggest that the protonmotive force of the h+ pump was unaffected by the diuretic."
1273,7364939L9,7364939,"this observation, plus the rapid onset and reversibility of the drugs, is consistent with an effect on the mucosal membrane to increase h+ conductance (k)."
1274,7364939L10,7364939,the findings raise the possibility that direct enhancement of renal h+ secretion may play a role in the metabolic alkalosis induced by some diuretics.

1276,24189473L1,24189473,"this disease is characterized by salt and fluid loss, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and sensorineural hearing impairment."
1277,24189473L2,24189473,"barttin is the β subunit of the clc k chloride channel, which recruits it to the plasma membranes, and the clc k/barttin complex contributes to transepithelial chloride transport in the kidney and inner ear."
1278,24189473L3,24189473,the retention of mutant forms of barttin in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) is etiologically linked to bartter syndrome type iv.
1279,24189473L4,24189473,"here, we report that treatment with 17 allylamino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin (17 aag), an hsp90 inhibitor, enhanced the plasma membrane expression of mutant barttins (r8l and g47r) in madin darby canine kidney cells."
1280,24189473L5,24189473,"administration of 17 aag to bsnd(r8l/r8l) knock in mice elevated the plasma membrane expression of r8l in the kidney and inner ear, thereby mitigating hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hearing loss."
1281,24189473L6,24189473,these results suggest that drugs that rescue er retained mutant barttin may be useful for treating patients with bartter syndrome type iv.
1282,12705033L0,12705033,hydrogen peroxide is used to bleach discoloured teeth but since its introduction in the late nineteenth century there have been concerns about its safety and efficacy.
1283,12705033L1,12705033,this paper reviews the literature on hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide and assesses if these products can be recommended for clinical use.
1284,12705033L2,12705033,"the authors used a medline search to find the literature for review and from these the findings were divided into laboratory, animal and human studies."
1285,12705033L3,12705033,in conclusion no dental treatment is without risk but from the evidence it seems that bleaching teeth is comparatively safe.
1286,1022281L0,1022281,"the effects of amphotericin b and nistatin on the membranes of dog kidney isolated nuclei after their incubation with the antibiotics in question, have been studied."
1287,1022281L1,1022281,"it is found that the polyene antibiotics, though they are superficially active compounds, have no solubilizing effect on nuclear membranes and do not change their chemical composition."
1288,1022281L2,1022281,"electrophoretic study has revealed that nuclear membrane proteins, besides high  and low molecular protein components, also contain a large amount of histones."
1289,1022281L3,1022281,"the incubation of the nuclei with the polyene antibiotics results in marked changes in the fractional composition of nuclear membrane proteins, the most significant changes being induced by amphotericin b. it is assumed that polyene antibiotics induce proteolytic degradation of nuclear membrane proteins."
1290,8381357L0,8381357,"murine resident peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and treated with phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitors zardaverine, rolipram and motapizone."
1291,8381357L1,8381357,the pde inhibitors suppressed the formation of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) by macrophages.
1292,8381357L2,8381357,"the mono selective pde iv inhibitor rolipram and the dual selective pde iii/iv inhibitor zardaverine had equal inhibitory potency, whereas the pde iii inhibitor motapizone was of lower inhibitory potency."
1293,8381357L3,8381357,"all pde inhibitors acted in synergy with the adenylate cyclase activators prostaglandin e2 and cg 4203, a prostacyclin analog, and super additive effects of combinations were observed."
1294,8381357L4,8381357,"the pde inhibitors also blocked the formation of leukotriene c4 (ltc4); however, substantially higher doses were needed than for blockade of tnf synthesis."
1295,8381357L5,8381357,"furthermore, no additive or synergistic effects were observed upon combined treatment with adenylate cyclase activators."
1296,8381357L6,8381357,it is suggested that the suppression of tnf formation by pde inhibitors is mediated mainly by a pde isoenzyme of type iv.
1297,8381357L7,8381357,the effect of pde inhibitors on ltc4 synthesis appears to be mediated by a different mechanism.
1298,16235565L0,16235565,"we developed a bigenic reporter system composed of a hybrid transcription factor that combines the regulatory and activation domains of either elk 1 or cyclic amp responsive element binding protein (creb) with the dna binding, dimerization, and regulatory domains from a synthetic variant of the bacterial tet repressor (tetr)."
1299,16235565L1,16235565,"the novel hybrid transcription factor tetr elk 1 was regulated by mapk erk kinase 1 (mek 1) overexpression, and tetr creb was regulated by protein kinase a (pka) overexpression or elevation of cyclic amp levels."
1300,16235565L2,16235565,"these hybrid transcription factors could be useful reporters of cell signaling pathways because, unlike previous gal4 hybrid reporters, tetr hybrid transcription factors are inhibited by the administration of doxycycline."
1301,16235565L3,16235565,we validated this system in cell culture transfection experiments utilizing luciferase assays to monitor reporter gene expression and western blot analysis to monitor transcription factor expression and phosphorylation levels.
1302,16235565L4,16235565,this system may be useful in creating temporally restricted windows of response to cell signaling and may be of value in the advancement of methods used to study signal transduction.

1308,16715354L5,16715354,the doas algorithms for the retrieval of total column amounts from nadir spectra are briefly described and case studies of pollution events are presented.
1309,16715354L6,16715354,we also illustrate the technique used to derive stratospheric concentration profiles from limb observations and show comparisons with other remote sensing systems.
1310,16715354L7,16715354,"special emphasis will be given to techniques, which take advantage of sciamachy's different viewing geometries."

1450,12027431L1,12027431,"analysis of the molecules and mechanisms involved in the specification of cardiac cell fates, differentiation and diversification of cardiac muscle cells, and morphogenesis and patterning of different cardiac cell types has revealed an evolutionarily conserved network of signaling pathways and transcription factors that underlies these processes."
1451,12027431L2,12027431,the regulatory network that controls the formation of the primitive heart in fruit flies has been elaborated upon to form the complex multichambered heart of mammals.
1452,12027431L3,12027431,we compare and contrast the mechanisms involved in heart formation in fruit flies and mammals in the context of a network of transcriptional interactions and point to unresolved questions for the future.
1453,7876045L0,7876045,malondialdehyde (mda) levels in the serum were estimated by mda tba (thiobarbituric acid) spectro colorimetric assay method in 23 rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients and were compared with those in 18 healthy subjects.
1454,7876045L1,7876045,it was found that the mean levels of mda (265.15 +/  68.8 n moles/100 ml) in patients with ra were found to be significantly elevated when compared to the mean of that of controls (128.76 +/  37.8 n moles/100 ml).
1455,7876045L2,7876045,this study reveals that mda assessment appears to be a sensitive marker of inflammation in this chronic auto immune disorder and would help in understanding the nature of inflammatory damage at a cellular level.
1456,9542752L0,9542752,ultraviolet (uv) radiation causes hemolysis of human erythrocytes in the presence of photosensitizers.
1457,9542752L1,9542752,this can be used as an in vitro model for evaluating photosensitizing properties of substances.
1458,9542752L2,9542752,antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin c) and d alpha tocopherol (vitamin e) have been found to be photoprotective in such test systems.
1459,9542752L3,9542752,we assessed the effect of combined systemic intake of both ascorbic acid and d alpha tocopherol by human volunteers on phototoxic in vitro lysis of their erythrocytes.
1460,9542752L4,9542752,"in a double blind placebo controlled study, 10 subjects took daily 2 g ascorbic acid combined with 1000 iu d alpha tocopherol, and 10 took a placebo."
1461,9542752L5,9542752,"blood was taken before and after 7 days of treatment, erythrocytes were prepared and then incubated with 10( 3) mol/l fenofibrate, a photosensitizer acting in the uva and uvb region."
1462,9542752L6,9542752,the suspensions were exposed to radiation rich in uva (up to 40 j/cm2 uva) or to radiation rich in uvb (up to 1.6 j/cm2).
1463,9542752L7,9542752,photohemolysis of the samples was calculated as a percentage of complete hemolysis.
1464,9542752L8,9542752,"at the end of the treatment phase, in the placebo group photohemolysis was not significantly reduced compared with the initial values at all irradiation doses except for 1.6 j/cm2 uvb (96% vs 79%; p < 0.01)."
1465,9542752L9,9542752,"in the group taking vitamins, photohemolysis was significantly reduced at nearly all uv doses, most impressively after moderate uva irradiation (20 j/cm2 uva: 86.5% vs 14.5%; p < 0.01)."
1466,9542752L10,9542752,it is concluded that the results of the photohemolysis test are influenced by the antioxidative status of the cell donor and that ascorbic acid and d alpha tocopherol also may protect against phototoxic damage in vivo.
1467,18720346L0,18720346,the availability of selenium and the levels of specific selenoproteins might affect cancer risk by influencing the ability of dna damaging agents to cause genomic instability and mutations.
1468,18720346L1,18720346,transgenic mice that express reduced levels of selenoproteins and previously shown to be more susceptible to pathology associated with cancer development were used to study this possibility.
1469,18720346L2,18720346,"these mice were exposed to x rays and dna damage assessed in the erythrocytes, where micronuclei formation was higher compared to the same cells obtained from irradiated wild type controls."
1470,18720346L3,18720346,"to determine whether the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 1 (gpx 1) might be involved in this protection, its levels were reduced by sirna targeting in lncap human prostate cells."
1471,18720346L4,18720346,uv induced micronuclei frequency was higher in these cells compared to control transfected cells.
1472,18720346L5,18720346,these results indicate a role for selenoproteins in protecting dna from damage and support human data implicating gpx 1 as a possible target of the chemoprotective effect of selenium.

1474,16416443L1,16416443,it is important to solve the structures of idhs from various species to correlate with its function and evolutionary significance.
1475,16416443L2,16416443,"so far, only two crystal structures of substrate/cofactor bound (isocitrate/nadp) nadp+ dependent monomeric idh from azotobacter vinelandii (avidh) have been solved."

1477,16416443L4,16416443,the 1.75 a structure of cgidh mg2+ showed a distinct open conformation in contrast to the closed conformation of avidh isocitrate/nadp+ complexes.
1478,16416443L5,16416443,fluorescence studies on cgidh in the presence of isocitrate/or nadp+ suggest the presence of low energy barrier conformers.
1479,16416443L6,16416443,"in cgidh, the amino acid residues corresponding to the escherichia coli idh phosphorylation loop are alpha helical compared with the more flexible random coil region in the e. coli protein where idh activation is controlled by phosphorylation."
1480,16416443L7,16416443,this more structured region supports the idea that activation of cgidh is not controlled by phosphorylation.
1481,16416443L8,16416443,"monomeric nadp+ specific idhs have been identified from about 50 different bacterial species, such as proteobacteria, actinobacteria, and planctomycetes, whereas, dimeric nadp+ dependent idhs are diversified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes."
1482,16416443L9,16416443,"we have constructed a phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of all bacterial monomeric nadp+ dependent idhs and also another one with specifically chosen species which either contains both monomeric and dimeric nadp+ dependent idhs or have monomeric nadp+ dependent, as well as nad+ dependent idhs."
1483,16416443L10,16416443,this is done to examine evolutionary relationships.
1484,23992551L0,23992551,"considering that guanidine based derivatives are good dna minor groove binders, we have theoretically studied, using the polarizable continuum model mimicking water solvation, the complexes formed by the biologically relevant guanidinium cation and the dna and rna nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil)."
1485,23992551L1,23992551,the interactions established within these complexes both by hydrogen bonds and by cation π interactions have been analyzed by means of the atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital approaches.
1486,23992551L2,23992551,"moreover, maps of electron density difference have been produced to understand the cation π complexes."
1487,23992551L3,23992551,"finally, the nics and three dimensional nics maps of the cation π complexes have been studied to understand the effect of the guanidinium cation on the aromaticity of the nucleobases."

1489,19140512L1,19140512,"the administration of maackia amurensis extract (200 mg/kg, p.o., during 14 days) reduces the level of lipid peroxidation, prevents a decrease in the total lipid content, normalizes the proportion of lipids and proteins, and eliminates the accumulation of lysophospholipids in erythrocyte membranes in ovariectomized rats."
1490,26148881L0,26148881,"aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (aldh1) is widely used as a specific cancer stem cell marker in a variety of cancers, and may become a promising target for cancer therapy."
1491,26148881L1,26148881,"however, the role of its expression in tumor cells and the microenvironment in different cancers is still controversial."
1492,26148881L2,26148881,"to clarify the clinicopathological effect of aldh1 expression in ovarian carcinoma, a series of 248 cases of paraffin embedded formalin fixed ovarian carcinoma tissues with long term follow up information were studied by immunohistochemistry."
1493,26148881L3,26148881,"the immunostaining of aldh1was variably detected in both tumor cells and the stromal cells, although the staining in tumor cells was not as strong as that in stromal cells."
1494,26148881L4,26148881,"statistical analyses showed that high aldh1 expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with histological subtypes, early figo stage, well differentiation grade and better survival probability (p < 0.05)."
1495,26148881L5,26148881,the expression of aldh1 in the stromal cells had no clinicopathological associations in the present study (p > 0.05).
1496,26148881L6,26148881,"high expression of cancer stem cell marker aldh1 in ovarian carcinoma cells may thus portend a favorable prognosis, but its expression in tumor microenvironment may have no role in tumor behavior of ovarian carcinomas."
1497,26148881L7,26148881,more studies are warranted to find out the mechanisms for this.
1498,19270525L0,19270525,telomeres are specialized structures that protect chromosome ends from degradation and fusion events.
1499,19270525L1,19270525,"in most organisms, telomeres consist of short, repetitive g rich sequences added to chromosome ends by a reverse transcriptase with an internal rna template, called telomerase."
1500,19270525L2,19270525,specific dna binding protein complexes associate with telomeric sequences preventing chromosome ends from being recognized as dna double strand breaks (dsbs).
1501,19270525L3,19270525,"telomeres that lose their cap activate the dna damage response (ddr) likewise dsbs and, if inappropriately repaired, generate telomeric fusions, which eventually lead to genome instability."
1502,19270525L4,19270525,"in drosophila there is not telomerase, and telomere length is maintained by transposition of three specialized retroelements."
1503,19270525L5,19270525,"however, fly telomeres are protected by multi protein complexes like their yeast and vertebrate counterparts; these complexes bind chromosome ends in a sequence independent fashion and are required to prevent checkpoint activation and end to end fusion."
1504,19270525L6,19270525,uncapped drosophila telomeres elicit a ddr just as dysfunctional human telomeres.
1505,19270525L7,19270525,"most interestingly, uncapped drosophila telomeres also activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (sac) by recruiting the sac kinase bubr1."
1506,19270525L8,19270525,bubr1 accumulations at chromosome ends trigger the sac that inhibits the metaphase to anaphase transition.
1507,19270525L9,19270525,"these findings, reviewed here, highlight an intriguing and unsuspected connection between telomeres and cell cycle regulation, providing a clue to understand human telomere function."
1508,2538404L0,2538404,"although membrane sh groups are thought to be targets of oxidative insults, no measurement of lens epithelial membrane sh groups following exposure to potentially damaging oxidants has been reported."
1509,2538404L1,2538404,"here we investigate the effect of hydrogen peroxide, an oxidant found in the aqueous humor, and of p chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (p chloromecuribenzene sulfonic acid) (pcmbs), a relatively impermeant sulfhydryl probe, on membrane sh groups and ion homeostasis in cultured lens epithelial cells."
1510,2538404L2,2538404,"exposure to pcmbs caused a 10% loss of membrane sh groups, an increase in sodium and calcium levels, and a decrease in potassium, but did not affect the intracellular level of glutathione (gsh)."
1511,2538404L3,2538404,"after 5 min of exposure to an initial concentration of 1.0 mm hydrogen peroxide, gsh declined from 14.1 mm to 3 mm, there was a 20% loss of membrane sh groups and within 1 hr, potassium declined from 132 to 116 mm."
1512,2538404L4,2538404,cells that were exposed to 0.1 or 0.5 mm peroxide did not exhibit significant loss of membrane sh groups and did not show a decrease in gsh comparable to that found in cells treated with 1 mm peroxide.
1513,2538404L5,2538404,the peroxide induced loss of membrane sh groups and subsequent change in ion homeostasis occurred only when there was a rapid and sustained loss of intracellular glutathione.
1514,2538404L6,2538404,thus lens epithelial cell membrane sh groups are not only important in ion regulation but are targets of hydrogen peroxide when the intracellular level of gsh is significantly diminished.
1515,10579908L0,10579908,"the patterning and morphogenesis of multicellular organisms require a complex interplay of inductive signals which control proliferation, growth arrest, and differentiation of different cell types."

1517,10579908L2,10579908,"the molecular dissection of these pathways demonstrated that in vertebrates, mutations or abnormals function of these signaling pathways were often associated with developmental disorders and cancer formation."
1518,10579908L3,10579908,the hedgehog (hh) family of secreted proteins provides a perfect example of such signaling proteins.
1519,10579908L4,10579908,"in the following review, we will not discuss in detail the role of hh as a morphogen, but rather focus on its signal transduction pathway and its role in various human disorders."
1520,7653636L0,7653636,"to examine their responsiveness to norepinephrine (ne) and acetylcholine (ach), outer medullary descending vasa recta (omdvr) have been dissected from vascular bundles of the rat and perfused in vitro."
1521,7653636L1,7653636,"abluminal application of ne produced graded vasoconstriction in a concentration range of 10( 9) 10( 6) m. when applied with ne, ach at concentrations of 10( 8) 10( 5) m dilated ne preconstricted omdvr."
1522,7653636L2,7653636,"in contrast, ach applied in the absence of ne caused vasoconstriction."
1523,7653636L3,7653636,"ach induced vasodilation was blocked by addition of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor n omega nitro l arginine (l nna, 2 x 10( 4) m)."
1524,7653636L4,7653636,l nna in the absence of ach enhanced ne induced vasoconstriction.
1525,7653636L5,7653636,"supraphysiological (10( 3) m) l arginine (l arg) reversed the effects of l nna, and abluminal application of l nna alone resulted in omdvr vasoconstriction."
1526,7653636L6,7653636,"at concentrations of 10( 6) 10( 3) m, abluminal application of l arg produced graded vasodilation of ne constricted omdvr."
1527,7653636L7,7653636,these results suggest that adrenergic and cholinergic innervation could influence omdvr vasomotor tone to modulate total and regional blood flow to the renal medulla.
1528,7653636L8,7653636,the data also favor a role for the activity of constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase to modulate omdvr vasoactivity.

1535,16728955L6,16728955,"the enzyme also exhibited a broad optimal ph (5.0 9.0), and remained stable over a broad temperature range (20 degrees c 60 degrees c)."
1536,16728955L7,16728955,"it maintained 90% activity against organic solvents (ethanol/chloroform) known hydroperoxidase inhibitors, and exhibited no detectable peroxidase activity."
1537,16728955L8,16728955,"the catalase activity of the purified enzyme was reduced to 19% of full activity as the result of the administration of 10 mm 3 amino 1,2,4 triazole, a heme containing catalase inhibitor."
1538,16728955L9,16728955,"sodium cyanide, sodium azide, and hydroxylamine, all of which are known heme protein inhibitors, inhibited catalase activity by 50% at concentrations of 11.5 microm, 0.52 microm, and 0.11 microm, respectively."

1546,17054445L6,17054445,"during a mean follow up of 3.4 yr from onset of autoimmunity, 28 children developed type 1 diabetes, at mean age of 6.5 yr. mean prediagnostic hba1c was 5.1% [standard deviation (sd) = 0.4%]."
1547,17054445L7,17054445,"in a cox regression model accounting for changes in values in individuals over time, increase in hba1c predicted increased risk of progression to type 1 diabetes, hazard ratio = 4.8 (95% confidence interval 3.0 7.7) for each sd of 0.4%, independent of random glucose and number of autoantibodies."
1548,17054445L8,17054445,"increase in random plasma glucose levels only marginally predicted risk of progression (hazard ratio = 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.02 1.8, per sd of 1.1 mmol/l)."
1549,17054445L9,17054445,"normal but increasing hb1ac may be useful in early detection of type 1 diabetes, whereas random plasma glucose levels were less predictive."

1567,8853374L5,8853374,"correlative data showing increased activities of some antioxidant enzymes during freezing, notably glutathione peroxidase (increasing 1.2  to 2.5 fold), as well as constitutively higher activities of antioxidant enzymes and higher levels of glutathione in the freeze tolerant species compared with rana pipiens, suggest that antioxidant defenses play a key role in amphibian freeze tolerance."
1568,22684298L0,22684298,senescent fibroblasts are known to promote tumor growth.
1569,22684298L1,22684298,"however, the exact mechanism remains largely unknown."
1570,22684298L2,22684298,an important clue comes from recent studies linking autophagy with the onset of senescence.
1571,22684298L3,22684298,"thus, autophagy and senescence may be part of the same physiological process, known as the autophagy senescence transition (ast)."
1572,22684298L4,22684298,"to test this hypothesis, human fibroblasts immortalized with telomerase (htert bj1) were stably transfected with autophagy genes (bnip3, ctsb or atg16l1)."
1573,22684298L5,22684298,"their overexpression was sufficient to induce a constitutive autophagic phenotype, with features of mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and a shift toward aerobic glycolysis, resulting in l lactate and ketone body production."
1574,22684298L6,22684298,"autophagic fibroblasts also showed features of senescence, with increased p21(waf1/cip1), a cdk inhibitor, cellular hypertrophy and increased β galactosidase activity."
1575,22684298L7,22684298,"thus, we genetically validated the existence of the autophagy senescence transition."
1576,22684298L8,22684298,"importantly, autophagic senescent fibroblasts promoted tumor growth and metastasis, when co injected with human breast cancer cells, independently of angiogenesis."
1577,22684298L9,22684298,"autophagic senescent fibroblasts stimulated mitochondrial metabolism in adjacent cancer cells, when the two cell types were co cultured, as visualized by mitotracker staining."
1578,22684298L10,22684298,"in particular, autophagic atg16l1 fibroblasts, which produced large amounts of ketone bodies (3 hydroxy butyrate), had the strongest effects and promoted metastasis by up to 11 fold."
1579,22684298L11,22684298,"conversely, expression of atg16l1 in epithelial cancer cells inhibited tumor growth, indicating that the effects of autophagy are compartment specific."
1580,22684298L12,22684298,"thus, autophagic senescent fibroblasts metabolically promote tumor growth and metastasis, by paracrine production of high energy mitochondrial fuels."
1581,22684298L13,22684298,"our current studies provide genetic support for the importance of ""two compartment tumor metabolism"" in driving tumor growth and metastasis via a simple energy transfer mechanism."
1582,22684298L14,22684298,"finally, β galactosidase, a known lysosomal enzyme and biomarker of senescence, was localized to the tumor stroma in human breast cancer tissues, providing in vivo support for our hypothesis."
1583,22684298L15,22684298,"bioinformatic analysis of genome wide transcriptional profiles from tumor stroma, isolated from human breast cancers, also validated the onset of an autophagy senescence transition."
1584,22684298L16,22684298,"taken together, these studies establish a new functional link between host aging, autophagy, the tumor microenvironment and cancer metabolism."
1585,15452193L0,15452193,gamma secretase inhibitors are one promising approach to the development of a therapeutic for alzheimer's disease (ad).
1586,15452193L1,15452193,"gamma secretase inhibitors reduce brain beta amyloid peptide (abeta), which is believed to be a major contributor in the etiology of ad."
1587,15452193L2,15452193,transgenic mice overexpressing the human beta amyloid precursor protein (app) are valuable models to examine the dynamics of abeta changes with gamma secretase inhibitors in plaque free and plaque bearing animals.

1589,15452193L4,15452193,"because csf and brain interstitial fluid are distinct compartments in composition and location, this correlation could not be assumed."
1590,15452193L5,15452193,"in contrast, aged transgenic mice with large accumulations of abeta in plaques showed reductions in csf abeta in the absence of measurable changes in plaque abeta in the brain after up to 2 weeks of treatment."
1591,15452193L6,15452193,"hence, csf abeta levels were a valuable measure of gamma secretase activity in the central nervous system in either the presence or absence of plaques."
1592,15452193L7,15452193,transgenic mice were also used to examine potential side effects due to notch inhibition.
1593,15452193L8,15452193,bms 299897 was 15 fold more effective at preventing the cleavage of app than of notch in vitro.
1594,15452193L9,15452193,"no changes in the maturation of cd8(+) thymocytes or of intestinal goblet cells were observed in mice treated with bms 299897, showing that it is possible for gamma secretase inhibitors to reduce brain abeta without causing notch mediated toxicity."

1596,28614771L1,28614771,the purpose of the present study was to investigate the underlying cellular mechanisms of the nitric oxide (no) releasing property of the aqueous extract of mantidis ootheca (amo) in rat aorta and vascular endothelial cells.
1597,28614771L2,28614771,amo was examined for its vascular relaxant effect in isolated phenylephrine precontracted rat thoracic aortic rings.
1598,28614771L3,28614771,the roles of the nitric oxide (no) signaling in the amo induced effects were tested in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs).

1603,9393638L2,9393638,"besides the three transport modes known to date, namely phosphate/phosphate exchange, phosphate/oh exchange and mercurial induced unidirectional transport, this channel activity represents the fourth transport mode of the pic."
1604,9393638L3,9393638,the pic channel activity was sensitive towards phosphate as its physiological substrate.
1605,9393638L4,9393638,"phosphate (10 mm) blocked in a specific but reversible manner the pic channel, suggesting a phosphate dependent conformational change of the protein into the carrier mode."
1606,9393638L5,9393638,"furthermore, the current through the channel and its gating activity were affected by divalent cations."
1607,9393638L6,9393638,"in the presence of ca2+ and mg2+, the channel displayed a mean conductance of 25 +/  5 ps whereas 40 +/  10 ps was observed in the absence of divalent cations."
1608,9393638L7,9393638,"also, the dwell times in either the open or closed state of the pic channel appeared to be prolonged in the presence of ca2+ and mg2+."
1609,9393638L8,9393638,the observed pic channel characteristics are discussed with respect to previously reported electrophysiological in situ measurements on anion channels of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

1611,20108250L0,20108250,previous studies related impaired myocardial microcirculation in diabetes to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.
1612,20108250L1,20108250,"thus, this study was aimed to determine the effect of up regulating pampk pakt signaling on coronary microvascular reactivity in the isolated heart of diabetic mice."
1613,20108250L2,20108250,"we measured coronary resistance in wild type and streptozotocin (stz) treated mice, during perfusion pressure changes."
1614,20108250L3,20108250,"glucose, insulin, and adiponectin levels in plasma and superoxide formation, nox levels and heme oxygenase (ho) activity in myocardial tissue were determined."
1615,20108250L4,20108250,"in addition, the expression of ho 1, 3 nitrotyrosine, plkb1, pampk, pakt, and penos proteins in control and diabetic hearts were measured."
1616,20108250L5,20108250,coronary response to changes in perfusion pressure diverged from control in a time dependent manner following stz administration.
1617,20108250L6,20108250,"the responses observed at 28 weeks of diabetes (the maximum time examined) were mimicked by l name administration to control animals and were associated with a decrease in serum adiponectin and myocardial plkb1, pampk, pakt, and pgsk 3 expression."
1618,20108250L7,20108250,cobalt protoporphyrin treatment to induce ho 1 expression reversed the microvascular reactivity seen in diabetes towards that of controls.
1619,20108250L8,20108250,"up regulation of ho 1 was associated with an increase in adiponectin, plkb1, pakt, pampk, pgsk 3, and penos levels and a decrease in myocardial superoxide and 3 nitrotyrosine levels."

1622,18809338L0,18809338,"the vitamin a metabolites, including retinoic acid (ra), form ligands for retinoic acid related nuclear receptors and together they play pleiotropic roles in various biological processes."
1623,18809338L1,18809338,"recently, we described that ra also functions as a key modulator of transforming growth factor beta (tgf beta) driven immune deviation, capable of suppressing the differentiation of interleukin 17 secreting t helper cells (t(h)17) and conversely promoting the generation of foxp3(+) t regulatory (treg) cells."
1624,18809338L2,18809338,"this review will focus on the role of ra in the reciprocal tgf beta driven differentiation of t(h)17 and treg and on the importance of such regulatory mechanism to control a functional immune system, in particular at the mucosal interface of the intestine."
1625,7260199L0,7260199,the kinetic behaviour of highly purified malate dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.37) from grape vine leaves has been studied.
1626,7260199L1,7260199,"the curves of the dependence of the initial velocity (v) on oxaloacetate and nadh concentrations at low concentration of the enzyme are hyperbolic, while at relatively high concentrations of the enzyme they are s shaped (nh = 2 and nh = 1.7 for oxaloacetate  and nadh, respectively)."
1627,7260199L2,7260199,"the dependence of v upon malate concentrations at low enzyme and substrate concentrations obeys the michaelis  menten equation (nh = 1.0); at relatively high concentration of the enzyme at any substrate concentrations of the enzyme it is characterized by ""negative"" kinetic cooperativity."
1628,7260199L3,7260199,"with respect to nad malate dehydrogenase at low enzyme concentrations reveals ""positive"" cooperativity (nh = 2.5), but at relatively high concentrations shows a hyperbolic dependence."
1629,7260199L4,7260199,"the specific malate dehydrogenase activity determined in both directions, i. e. reduction of oxaloacetate and oxidation of malate, strongly depends on the enzyme concentration."
1630,7260199L5,7260199,at low and relatively high concentrations of the enzyme the specific malate dehydrogenase activity sharply decreases.
1631,7260199L6,7260199,therefore malate dehydrogenase can be attributed to reversibly associating oligomeric allosteric enzymes.
1632,10720416L0,10720416,"cardiomyocyte death after ischemia/reperfusion correlates with oxidant stress, and antioxidants confer protection in that model."
1633,10720416L1,10720416,"preconditioning (pc) with hypoxia or adenosine also confers protection, leading us to hypothesize that pc protects by attenuating oxidant generation during subsequent ischemia/reperfusion."
1634,10720416L2,10720416,"chick cardiomyocytes were preconditioned with 10 minutes of hypoxia or adenosine (100 micromol/l), followed by 1 hour of simulated ischemia and 3 hours of reperfusion."
1635,10720416L3,10720416,"adenosine pc decreased cell death from 50+/ 3% to 18+/ 4% and enhanced the return of contractions during reperfusion, as observed previously with hypoxic pc."
1636,10720416L4,10720416,a transient burst of dichlorofluorescein (sensitive to h2o2 oxidation that was significantly attenuated by pc initiated by hypoxia or adenosine was seen at reperfusion.
1637,10720416L5,10720416,the protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor go 6976 and the mitochondrial atp sensitive k(+) (k(atp)) channel inhibitor 5 hydroxydecanoate each abolished protection and abrogated the pc induced attenuation of reperfusion oxidant stress.
1638,10720416L6,10720416,"by contrast, when given only at reperfusion, the k(+) channel opener pinacidil or the antioxidants 2 mercaptopropionylglycine and 1,10 phenanthroline decreased oxidant stress at reperfusion and improved survival and return of contractions."
1639,10720416L7,10720416,"thus, pc protection is associated with an attenuation of the oxidant burst at reperfusion, regardless of the method by which pc is triggered."
1640,10720416L8,10720416,loss of pc protection associated with pkc inhibition or k(atp) channel inhibitors is associated with a restoration of that oxidant stress.
1641,10720416L9,10720416,these results suggest a mechanism for pc protection and reveal a functional link between pkc activation and k(atp) channel activation in that pathway.

1647,26002201L5,26002201,both enzymes were active with recombinant nucleosome as substrate.
1648,26002201L6,26002201,"however, setd2 but not ash1l methylated histone peptides as well indicating that the interaction of the basic post set extension with substrate may not be critical for setd2 activity."
1649,26002201L7,26002201,both enzymes were not active with nucleosome containing a h3k36a mutation indicating their specificity for h3k36.
1650,26002201L8,26002201,"analyzing the methylation state of the products of ash1l and setd2 reactions also confirmed that both enzymes mono  and dimethylate h3k36 and are inactive with h3k4 as substrate, and that only setd2 is able to trimethylate h3k36 in vitro."
1651,26002201L9,26002201,we determined the kinetic parameters for ash1l and setd2 activity enabling screening for inhibitors that can be used to further investigate the roles of these two proteins in health and disease.
1652,26002201L10,26002201,both ash1l and setd2 are h3k36 specific methyltransferases but only setd2 can trimethylate this mark.
1653,26002201L11,26002201,the basic post set extension is critical for ash1l but not setd2 activity.

1668,11162667L0,11162667,"this study, conducted on nih3t3 cells, demonstrates that gsh depletion obtained by buthionine sulfoximine (bso) treatment does not affect platelet derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) autophosphorylation or cell protein phosphorylation induced by exogenous addition of h2o2, while it does decrease tyrosine phosphorylation obtained by pdgf stimulation."
1669,11162667L1,11162667,this last effect seems due to the lack of h2o2 generation; for the first time a relation between intracellular gsh content and h2o2 production induced by pdgf has been demonstrated.
1670,11162667L2,11162667,"therefore, changes of gsh levels can affect the early events of the pdgfr signal pathways by redox regulation."
1671,11162667L3,11162667,"it has also demonstrated that in nih3t3 cells, h2o2 can directly activate tyrosine phosphorylation by a reversible effect with the involvement of sh group."

1729,6296816L6,6296816,"evidence to substantiate this identification was provided by the finding that both the porin activity and the 29,000 dalton polypeptide were entirely resistant when the omm fraction was exposed to trypsin digestion, with the 29,000 dalton polypeptide being virtually the only polypeptide in the omm fraction to be unaffected by trypsin digestion."
1730,6296816L7,6296816,there was no protection when trypsin digestion was carried out in the presence of detergent.
1731,6296816L8,6296816,"using monospecific antibodies, we have shown that yeast porin is apparently not synthesized as a larger precursor in a cell free translation system."

1734,6296816L11,6296816,this membrane specificity suggests that integration does not proceed by unassisted partitioning.
1735,6296816L12,6296816,the integration of porin into whole mitochondria occurred with fidelity by the criterion of its resistance to trypsin.

1739,18948571L2,18948571,we show that human cd34(+) thymocytes can differentiate into cd4(+)cd8beta(+) double positive (dp) thymocytes in the absence of notch signaling.
1740,18948571L3,18948571,"while these dp cells phenotypically resemble human beta selected cells, they lack a t cell receptor (tcr) beta chain."

1753,11811552L6,11811552,this shows that the induction of endogenous bmps by coculture does not regulate osteogenesis in an autocrine manner.
1754,11811552L7,11811552,"these results show that chondrocytes express soluble morphogenetic factors that selectively promote osteogenesis, and this selective effect is not mimicked by an exogenously added bmp."

2083,10713079L7,10713079,"furthermore, because the addition of h(2)o(2), a downstream product of nadph oxidase, could only activate k(+) currents during hypoxia (when endogenous h(2)o(2) production is suppressed), it appears likely that pkc modulates the affinity of nadph oxidase for o(2) potentially via phosphorylation of the p47(phox) subunit, which is present in these cells."
2084,10713079L8,10713079,these data show that pkc is an important regulator of the o(2) transduction pathway and suggests that nadph oxidase represents a significant component of the airway o(2) sensor.

2213,8148880L5,8148880,these results demonstrate a complex role for phytochrome b in arabidopsis photo morphogenesis and suggest that the expression level of this phytochrome gene is an important determinant of the intensity of light induced plant responses.

2224,22303668L0,22303668,"taking high oil peanut cultivar yuhua15 and high protein peanut cultivar xb023 as test materials, a pot experiment was conducted in both 2009 and 2010 to study the effects of applying different concentration calcium (ca) on the vegetative growth, leaf chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and protective enzyme activities, as well as the yield and kernel quality of the cultivars under cadmium (cd) stress."
2225,22303668L1,22303668,"applying ca alleviated the inhibitory effects of cd on the height growth of peanut main stem and the length growth of the branches, resulting in the increase of plant dry mass, and mitigated the cd damage on peanut leaf, manifesting in the increase of leaf chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, superoxide dismutase (sod), peroxidase (pod), and catlase (cat) activities, and soluble protein content, and the decrease of leaf malondialdeyde (mda) content."
2226,22303668L2,22303668,"under the application of ca, both the pod yield and the kernel yield increased, mainly because of the increase of pod number per plant and of the kernel number per pod."
2227,22303668L3,22303668,"applying ca also promoted the transformation of soluble sugar into fat and protein in peanut kernel, increased the kernel fat and protein contents, and improved the kernel quality under cd stress."

2230,15361698L1,15361698,increased oxidative stress is one of the risk factors for enhanced atherosclerosis in this population.
2231,15361698L2,15361698,literature data vary partially dependent on differences in methodology.
2232,15361698L3,15361698,"the present study compares three different methods: plasma lipid peroxides, the newly developed measurement of circulating oxidized ldl (ox ldl) particles and the frequently used copper induced ldl oxidation lag time."
2233,15361698L4,15361698,"we assessed plasma lipid peroxides, circulating ox ldl and in vitro copper induced ldl oxidation lag time in 47 non diabetic patients with esrd, at the start of renal replacement therapy, and compared these with 41 age  and sex matched controls."
2234,15361698L5,15361698,"in esrd, total cholesterol (4.6 +/  1.1 vs. 5.6 +/  0.9 mmol/l; p < 0.001), ldl cholesterol (2.8 +/  0.8 vs. 3.5 +/  0.7 mmol/l; p < 0.001) and hdl cholesterol (1.0 +/  0.3 vs. 1.4 +/  0.4 mmol/l; p < 0.001) were lower compared to controls."
2235,15361698L6,15361698,plasma lipid peroxides were higher (1.1 +/  0.5 vs. 0.8 +/  0.5 micromol/l; p = 0.003) in esrd.
2236,15361698L7,15361698,no differences were observed in plasma ox ldl (63.1 +/  62.0 vs. 55.3 +/  48.0 mg/l).
2237,15361698L8,15361698,"however, due to the lower plasma ldl cholesterol in esrd, ldl oxidation level was increased in esrd (7.1 +/  0.1 vs. 4.2 +/  0.3%; p = 0.03)."
2238,15361698L9,15361698,ldl lag time was slightly longer (89 +/  11 vs. 84 +/  11 min; p = 0.04) in esrd.
2239,15361698L10,15361698,there were no significant differences regarding the amount and rate of dienes produced.
2240,15361698L11,15361698,"elevated levels of lipid peroxides and higher ldl oxidation levels support the theory that esrd is associated with increased oxidative stress, which may explain the accelerated atherosclerosis."
2241,15361698L12,15361698,the measured amount of oxidative stress is not reflected by in vitro oxidizability of ldl.
2242,29753375L0,29753375,"oxidative stress occuring in patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), but the relationship between oxidative stress, disease activity and inflammatory markers has not been well established."
2243,29753375L1,29753375,"a total of 30 patients diagnosed with ibd and 30 volunteers who had normal colonoscopies, selected as controls, were used for this study."
2244,29753375L2,29753375,the serum levels of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase) and oxidative markers (malondialdehyde [mda] and total antioxidant capacity) were compared between the 2 groups.
2245,29753375L3,29753375,"furthermore, their correlations with disease activity scores and inflammatory markers, especially the fecal calprotectin, were examined."
2246,29753375L4,29753375,catalase and glutathione peroxidase concentrations were significantly correlated with the level of fecal calprotectin in patients with ibd.
2247,29753375L5,29753375,"nevertheless, there were no significant correlations between the concentrations of the above mentioned enzymes and c reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or the activity scores of ibd patients."
2248,29753375L6,29753375,it should be noted that mda and total antioxidant capacity levels did not correlate with the inflammatory markers or the disease activity scores.
2249,29753375L7,29753375,"there was a positive correlation between fecal calprotectin and serum antioxidant enzymes in patients with ibd, but, there was no correlation between antioxidant and oxidative markers in terms of disease activity scores."
2250,29753375L8,29753375,"hence, the observed significant correlation between the antioxidant enzymes and the fecal calprotectin may be due to either the pro oxidant potential of calprotectin or its antioxidant role."
2251,21052777L0,21052777,improvement of the cell free protein synthesis system (cf) over the past decade have made it one of the most powerful protein production methods.
2252,21052777L1,21052777,the cf approach is especially useful for stable isotope (si) labeling of proteins for nmr analysis.
2253,21052777L2,21052777,"however, it is less popular than expected, partly because the si labeled amino acids used for si labeling by the cf are too expensive."
2254,21052777L3,21052777,"in the present study, we developed a simple and inexpensive method for producing an si labeled protein using escherichia coli cell extract based cf."
2255,21052777L4,21052777,"this method takes advantage of endogenous metabolic conversions to generate si labeled asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, and tryptophan, which are much more expensive than the other 16 kinds of si labeled amino acids, from inexpensive sources, such as si labeled algal amino acid mixture, si labeled indole, and sodium sulfide, during the cf reaction."
2256,21052777L5,21052777,"as compared with the conventional method employing 20 kinds of si labeled amino acids, highly enriched uniform si labeling with similar labeling efficiency was achieved at a greatly reduced cost with the newly developed method."
2257,21052777L6,21052777,"therefore, our method solves the cost problem of the si labeling of proteins using the cf."
2258,24759427L0,24759427,"staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen, implicated in both community and hospital acquired infections."
2259,24759427L1,24759427,the therapy for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections is becoming more difficult because of multidrug resistance and strong biofilmforming properties.
2260,24759427L2,24759427,schiff bases have attracted attention as promising antibacterial agents.
2261,24759427L3,24759427,"in this study, we investigated the in vitro activity of taurine 5 bromosalicylaldehyde schiff base (tbssb) against mrsa."
2262,24759427L4,24759427,the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined using a microtiter broth dilution method.
2263,24759427L5,24759427,"tbssb effectively inhibited planktonic mrsa, with an mic of 32 μg/ml."
2264,24759427L6,24759427,the time kill curve confirmed that tbssb exhibited bactericidal activity against mrsa.
2265,24759427L7,24759427,"tbssb was also found to significantly inhibit mrsa biofilm formation at 24 h, especially at 1×mic and sub mic levels."
2266,24759427L8,24759427,"furthermore, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed remarkable morphological and ultrastructural changes on the mrsa cell surface, due to exposure to tbssb."
2267,24759427L9,24759427,this study indicated that tbssb may be an effective bactericidal agent against mrsa.
2268,9368915L0,9368915,the effect of chronic stress (immobilization and cold) on hepatic and gastric thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbars) and vitamin c levels were investigated in rats having long term depletion of glutathione (gsh) by applying buthionine sulfoximine (bso).
2269,9368915L1,9368915,gsh and vitamin c levels decreased and tbars levels increased in the liver and stomach of rats subjected to stress.
2270,9368915L2,9368915,long term bso administration along with stress caused no additional changes in these parameters.
2271,9368915L3,9368915,these results may indicate that long term glutathione depletion did not potentiate stress induced hepatic and gastric lipid peroxidation.
2272,2188974L0,2188974,the mechanism of copper uptake in saccharomyces cerevisiae has been investigated using a combination of 64cu2+ and atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
2273,2188974L1,2188974,a wild type copper resistant cup 1r containing strain and a strain carrying a deletion of the cup1 locus (yeast copper metallothionein) exhibited quantitatively similar saturable energy dependent 64cu2+ uptake when cultures were pregrown in copper free media (medium [cu] approximately 15 nm).
2274,2188974L2,2188974,the kinetic constants for uptake by the wild type strain were vmax = 0.21 nmol of copper/min/mg of protein and km = 4.4 microm.
2275,2188974L3,2188974,this accumulation of 64cu2+ represented net uptake as confirmed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
2276,2188974L4,2188974,"this uptake was not seen in glucose starved cells, but was supported in glycerol  and ethanol grown ones."
2277,2188974L5,2188974,"uptake was inhibited by both n3  and dinitrophenol and was barely detectable in cultures at 4 degrees c. when present at 50 microm, zn2+ and ni2+ inhibited by 50% indicating that this uptake process was relatively selective for cu2+."
2278,2188974L6,2188974,64cu2+ accumulation was qualitatively and quantitatively different in cultures either grown in or preincubated with cold cu2+.
2279,2188974L7,2188974,"either treatment resulted in the appearance of a fast phase (t 1/2 approximately 1 min) of 64cu2+ accumulation which represented isotopic exchange since it did not lead to an increase in the mass of cell associated copper; also, it was not energy dependent."
2280,2188974L8,2188974,exchange of 64cu2+ into this pool was not inhibited by zn2+.
2281,2188974L9,2188974,pretreatment with cu2+ caused a change in the rate of net accumulation as well; a 3 h incubation of cells in 5 microm medium cu2+ caused a 1.6 fold increase in the velocity of energy dependent uptake.
2282,2188974L10,2188974,"prior addition of cycloheximide abolished this cu2(+) dependent increase and, in fact, inhibited the 64cu2+ uptake velocity by greater than 85%."
2283,2188974L11,2188974,"the exchangeable pool was also absent in cycloheximide, cu2(+) treated cells suggesting that exchangeable cu2+ derived from the copper taken up initially by the energy dependent process."
2284,2188974L12,2188974,the thionein deletion mutant was similar to wild type in response to medium cu2+ and cycloheximide indicating that copper metallothionein is not directly involved in cu2+ uptake (as distinct from retention) in yeast.
2285,8632674L0,8632674,the inhibition of human leukaemia 60 cell growth by s d lactoylglutathione in vitro is mediated by the inhibtion of de novo pyridimine synthesis.
2286,8632674L1,8632674,"when s d lactoylglutathione was added to human leukaemia 60 cells in culture, it was hydrolysed by thiolesterase activity to reduced glutathione and d lactate but also converted to n d lactoylcysteinylglycine and n d lactoylcysteine by gamma glutamyl transferase and dipeptidase."
2287,8632674L2,8632674,the n d lactoylcysteine inhibited human leukaemia 60 cell growth: the median growth inhibitory concentration ic(50) value was 46.7 +/  0.9 (n=30) and the median toxic concentration tc(50) value was 103 +/  1 microm.
2288,8632674L3,8632674,"other n (r)2 hydroxyacylcysteine derivatives, n d mandelylcysteine and n l glyceroylcysteine, were less effective inhibitors of human leukaemia 60 cell growth, whereas n d lactoylcysteine ethyl ester was more effective: the ic(50) value was 16.5 +/  1.5 microm(n=8)."
2289,8632674L4,8632674,cytotoxic concentrations of s d lactoylglutathione induced apoptosis in human leukaemia 60 cells.
2290,8632674L5,8632674,the s d lactoylglutathione was not toxic to peripheral human lymphocytes at the same concentrations but rather induced growth arrest.
2291,8632674L6,8632674,"the expected mechanism of action of n d lactoylcysteine is inhibition of dihydro orotase, which is particularly susceptible to inhibition by cysteine derivatives."
2292,2992380L0,2992380,"an anionic peroxidase (ec 1.11.1.7), thought to be involved in suberization, was purified 110 fold from wound healing slices of solanum tuberosum by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, sephadex g 100 gel filtration, isoelectric focusing, and phenyl sepharose cl 4b chromatography in 24% yield."
2293,2992380L1,2992380,the purified enzyme was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and horizontal thin layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
2294,2992380L2,2992380,"the molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 47,000 by both sephadex g 100 gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
2295,2992380L3,2992380,"this peroxidase was found to be a glycoprotein containing about 17% carbohydrate, approximately one quarter of which was shown to be glucosamine residues."
2296,2992380L4,2992380,it was found to have an isoelectric point of 3.15. an anionic peroxidase was also isolated from abscisic acid treated callus tissue culture of s. tuberosum by the above purification procedure.
2297,2992380L5,2992380,"the two enzymes were shown to be immunologically similar, if not identical, based on their cross reactivity with rabbit antibody prepared against the peroxidase from wound healing slices, whereas the major cationic peroxidase from wound healing slices did not cross react with this antibody."
2298,2992380L6,2992380,"the anionic enzyme from both sources showed very similar specific activities when assayed with a range of substrates, whereas the specific activities found for the cationic isozyme isolated from wound healing slices were quite different."
2299,9778569L0,9778569,13c and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) was used to investigate the metabolism of l lactate and d glucose in c6 glioma cells.
2300,9778569L1,9778569,"the 13c enrichment of cell metabolites was examined after a 4 h incubation in media containing 5.5 mm glucose and 11 mm lactate, each metabolite being alternatively labelled with either [1 13c]d glucose or [3 13c]l lactate."
2301,9778569L2,9778569,the results indicated that exogenous lactate was the major substrate for oxidative metabolism.
2302,9778569L3,9778569,"they were consistent with the concept of the existence of 2 pools of both lactate and pyruvate, of which 1 pool was closely connected with exogenous lactate and oxidative metabolism, and the other pool was closely related to glycolysis and disconnected from oxidative metabolism."
2303,9778569L4,9778569,"the molecular basis of this behaviour could be related to different locations for the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, as suggested by their immunohistochemical labelling."
2304,16547439L0,16547439,pulmonary vasodilators are important in the management of pulmonary hypertension.
2305,16547439L1,16547439,"although systemic vasodilators may be effective in lowering pulmonary artery pressure, systemic vasodilation is the main limitation to dose titration."
2306,16547439L2,16547439,this review summarizes the latest research and developments in pulmonary vasodilators in the management of acute and chronic pulmonary hypertension.
2307,16547439L3,16547439,"nitric oxide, the prototype of selective pulmonary vasodilators, remains an effective option in the management of pulmonary hypertension; however, cost and complexity of administration have led to consideration of other pulmonary vasodilators."
2308,16547439L4,16547439,animal research suggests that nitric oxide may have an important role in the prevention of pulmonary hypertension after cardiopulmonary bypass.
2309,16547439L5,16547439,"experience with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy, suggests that these agents improve cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and can be considered as alternatives and/or adjuncts to nitric oxide."
2310,16547439L6,16547439,prostacyclins are a versatile class of pulmonary vasodilator as they have been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics administered intravenously or via inhalation.
2311,16547439L7,16547439,endothelin receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective for long term management of pulmonary hypertension.
2312,16547439L8,16547439,several gene therapy strategies are currently undergoing evaluation.
2313,16547439L9,16547439,selective pulmonary vasodilation can be achieved through delivery of vasodilators directly to the lungs or targeting pulmonary specific processes.
2314,16547439L10,16547439,several therapeutic options are available that demonstrate selectivity for the pulmonary vasculature.
2315,16547439L11,16547439,these agents can facilitate optimization of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics.
2316,5938411L0,5938411,patients with homocystinuria excrete in their urine small amounts of an amino acid indistinguishable from authentic l homolanthionine.
2317,5938411L1,5938411,this compound could be formed from homocysteine and homoserine by a condensation analogous to that normally leading to cystathionine.
2318,5938411L2,5938411,the only other known occurrence of homolanthionine in nature is in a methionine requiring mutant strain of escherichia coli.
2319,24027309L0,24027309,"borna disease virus (bdv) is a nonsegmented, negative stranded rna virus characterized by noncytolytic persistent infection and replication in the nuclei of infected cells."
2320,24027309L1,24027309,"to gain further insight on the intracellular trafficking of bdv components during infection, we sought to generate recombinant bdv (rbdv) encoding fluorescent fusion viral proteins."
2321,24027309L2,24027309,"we successfully rescued a virus bearing a tetracysteine tag fused to bdv p protein, which allowed assessment of the intracellular distribution and dynamics of bdv using real time live imaging."
2322,24027309L3,24027309,"in persistently infected cells, viral nuclear inclusions, representing viral factories tethered to chromatin, appeared to be extremely static and stable, contrasting with a very rapid and active trafficking of bdv components in the cytoplasm."
2323,24027309L4,24027309,"photobleaching (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching [frap] and fluorescence loss in photobleaching [flip]) imaging approaches revealed that bdv components were permanently and actively exchanged between cellular compartments, including within viral inclusions, albeit with a fraction of bdv p protein not mobile in these structures, presumably due to its association with viral and/or cellular proteins."
2324,24027309L5,24027309,"we also obtained evidence for transfer of viral material between persistently infected cells, with routing of the transferred components toward the cell nucleus."
2325,24027309L6,24027309,"finally, coculture experiments with noninfected cells allowed visualization of cell to cell bdv transmission and movement of the incoming viral material toward the nucleus."
2326,24027309L7,24027309,"our data demonstrate the potential of tetracysteine tagged recombinant bdv for virus tracking during infection, which may provide novel information on the bdv life cycle and on the modalities of its interaction with the nuclear environment during viral persistence."
2327,22642567L0,22642567,retinoids display anti tumour activity on various cancer cells and therefore have been used as important therapeutic agents.
2328,22642567L1,22642567,"however, adverse side effects and ra (retinoic acid) resistance limit further development and clinical application of retinoid based therapeutic agents."
2329,22642567L2,22642567,we report in the present paper the identification of a natural marine product that activates rars (ra receptors) with a chemical structure distinct from retinoids by high throughput compound library screening.
2330,22642567L3,22642567,"luffariellolide was uncovered as a novel rar agonist by inducing co activator binding to these receptors in vitro, further inhibiting cell growth and regulating rar target genes in various cancer cells."
2331,22642567L4,22642567,structural and molecular studies unravelled a unique binding mode of this natural ligand to rars with an unexpected covalent modification on the rar.
2332,22642567L5,22642567,"functional characterization further revealed that luffariellolide displays chemotherapeutic potentials for overcoming ra resistance in colon cancer cells, suggesting that luffariellolide may represent a unique template for designing novel non retinoid compounds with advantages over current ra drugs."

2335,10611226L2,10611226,"using rna differential display, we find that genes encoding three cyclins (cln1, cln3, and clb2), cys3, and smf2 are downregulated when xbp1 is overexpressed and that xbp1 can bind to sequences in their promoters."
2336,10611226L3,10611226,"during meiosis, xbp1 is highly induced and its mrna appears at the same time as dit1 mrna, but its expression remains high for up to 24 h. as such, it represents a new class of meiosis specific genes."
2337,10611226L4,10611226,"xbp1 deficient cells are capable of forming viable gametes, although ascus formation is delayed by several hours."
2338,10611226L5,10611226,"furthermore, xbp1 target genes are normally repressed late in meiosis, and loss of xbp1 results in their derepression."
2339,10611226L6,10611226,"interestingly, we find that a deletion of cln1 also reduces the efficiency of sporulation and delays the meiotic program but that sporulation in a deltacln1 deltaxbp1 strain is not further delayed."

2342,12207176L0,12207176,bid is an abundant pro apoptotic protein of the bcl 2 family that is crucial for death receptor mediated apoptosis in many cell systems.
2343,12207176L1,12207176,"bid action has been proposed to involve the mitochondrial re location of its truncated form, tbid, to facilitate the release of apoptogenic proteins like cytochrome c. however, the precise mechanism of (t)bid action is unknown."

2348,15373804L2,15373804,the functional receptor for 20e is a heterodimer consisting of the ecdysone receptor and ultraspiracle (usp) whereas the identity of the jh receptor remains unknown.
2349,15373804L3,15373804,we have cloned and sequenced a cdna encoding apis mellifera ultraspiracle (amusp) and examined its responses to jh.
2350,15373804L4,15373804,"a rapid, but transient up regulation of the amusp messenger is observed in the fat bodies of both queens and workers."
2351,15373804L5,15373804,amusp appears to be a single copy gene that produces two transcripts ( approximately 4 and approximately 5 kb) that are differentially expressed in the animal's body.
2352,15373804L6,15373804,the predicted amusp protein shows greater sequence similarity to its orthologues from the vertebrate crab tick locust group than to the dipteran lepidopteran group.
2353,15373804L7,15373804,these characteristics and the rapid up regulation by jh suggest that some of the usp functions in the honey bee may depend on ligand binding.

2427,11731238L0,11731238,the hmg domain transcription factor sox10 is essential for the development of various neural crest derived lineages including glia and neurons of the peripheral nervous system (pns).
2428,11731238L1,11731238,within the pns the most striking defect is the complete absence of glial differentiation whereas neurogenesis seemed initially normal.
2429,11731238L2,11731238,a degeneration of motoneurons and sensory neurons occurred later in development.
2430,11731238L3,11731238,"the mechanism that leads to the dramatic effects on the neural crest derived cell lineages in the dorsal root ganglia (drg), however, has not been examined up to now."

2434,2725511L1,2725511,factor 5 was found to be required for accurate initiation of transcription from specific promoters and also had a dramatic effect on the elongation properties of rna polymerase ii.
2435,2725511L2,2725511,"kinetic studies suggested that factor 5 stimulates the elongation rate of rna polymerase ii on a dc tailed, double stranded template by reducing the time spent at the numerous pause sites encountered by the polymerase."
2436,2725511L3,2725511,the factor was found to be composed of two polypeptides (34 and 86 kilodaltons).
2437,2725511L4,2725511,both subunits bound tightly to pure rna polymerase ii but were not bound to polymerase in elongation complexes.
2438,2725511L5,2725511,our results suggest that factor 5 interacts briefly with the paused polymerase molecules and catalyzes a conformational change in them such that they adopt an elongation competent conformation.
2439,19680759L0,19680759,the dust samples from 52 different locations in central roads of samsun city were collected in a study area of 40 km long for the purpose of determining total metal concentrations of dust samples by flame atomic absorption spectrometry.

2441,19680759L2,19680759,the results showed that metal levels were higher around the industrial area than other locations.
2442,19680759L3,19680759,principal component analysis was also carried out to ascertain the possible contributing factors towards the metal concentrations.

2444,7915139L0,7915139,the modulation of p glycoprotein by protein kinase c alpha (pkc alpha) was examined in a baculovirus expression system.
2445,7915139L1,7915139,"pgp was phosphorylated in membrane vesicle preparations in vitro only when coexpressed with pkc alpha, and phosphorylation was ca(2+) dependent and inhibited by the pkc inhibitor ro 31 8220. pgp and pkc alpha were tightly associated in membrane vesicles and were coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against either pgp or pkc alpha."
2446,7915139L2,7915139,photoaffinity labeling of membrane vesicles with [3h]azidopine indicated that drug binding to pgp was slightly increased in the presence of pkc alpha.
2447,7915139L3,7915139,"in contrast, pgp atpase activity was increased by pkc alpha as well as by verapamil, but only pkc stimulated activity in the presence of verapamil was inhibited by ro 31 8220. mutation of serine 671 to asparagine in the linker region of pgp abolished pkc alpha stimulated atpase activity, and also inhibited to a lesser degree verapamil stimulated atpase activity."
2448,7915139L4,7915139,these results indicate that pkc alpha in a positive regulator of pgp atpase activity and suggest that this mechanism may account for the increased multidrug resistance observed in mdr1 expressing cells when pkc alpha activity is elevated.
2449,11006280L0,11006280,intracellular ca(2+) is able to control numerous cellular responses through complex spatiotemporal organization.
2450,11006280L1,11006280,"ca(2+) waves mediated by inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors propagate by ca(2+) induced ca(2+) release and therefore do not have an absolute requirement for a gradient in either inositol trisphosphate or cyclic adp ribose, respectively."
2451,11006280L2,11006280,"in contrast, we report that although ca(2+) increases induced by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (naadp) are amplified by ca(2+) induced ca(2+) release locally, ca(2+) waves mediated by naadp have an absolute requirement for an naadp gradient."
2452,11006280L3,11006280,"if naadp is increased such that its concentration is spatially uniform in one region of an egg, the ca(2+) increase occurs simultaneously throughout this area, and only where there is diffusion out of this area to establish an naadp gradient is there a ca(2+) wave."
2453,11006280L4,11006280,a local increase in naadp results in a ca(2+) increase that spreads by naadp diffusion.
2454,11006280L5,11006280,"naadp diffusion is restricted at low but not high concentrations of naadp, indicating that naadp diffusion is strongly influenced by binding to immobile and saturable sites, probably the naadp receptor itself."
2455,11006280L6,11006280,"thus, the range of action of naadp can be tuned by its concentration from that of a local messenger, like ca(2+), to that of a global messenger, like ip(3) or cyclic adp ribose."
2456,3340613L0,3340613,endotoxin greatly reduces lung injury and pleural effusions in adult rats exposed to normobaric hyperoxia (greater than 98% oxygen for 60 hours).
2457,3340613L1,3340613,this study reports that serum from endotoxin treated donor rats protects serum recipients against hyperoxic lung injury without altering lung superoxide dismutase (sod) activity.
2458,3340613L2,3340613,rats pretreated with endotoxin alone were protected and exhibited an increase in lung sod activity as previously reported by others.
2459,3340613L3,3340613,protection by serum was not due to the transfer of residual endotoxin or sod.
2460,3340613L4,3340613,these results show that protection from oxygen toxicity can occur in rats without an increase in lung sod and suggest that a serum factor may be involved.

2470,20369241L4,20369241,"the kidney samples were stored for the measurement of malondialdehyde (mda), glutathione peroxidase (gshpx), superoxide dismutase (sod), and catalase (cat) activities and processed for histopathological examinations."
2471,20369241L5,20369241,"administration of cisplatin to rats induced a marked renal failure, characterized with a significant increase in serum bun and uric acid concentrations, and they had higher kidney mda and lower gsh px, sod, and cat activities."
2472,20369241L6,20369241,"in the groups that were administered rj in association with cp, improvement was observed in some oxidative stress parameters and certain other biochemical parameters, pre treatment with rj being more effective."
2473,20369241L7,20369241,the cp induced changes in histopathologic findings of kidneys were partially reversed by treatment with royal jelly.
2474,20369241L8,20369241,the results provide further insight into the mechanisms of cp induced nephrotoxicity and confirm the antioxidant potential of royal jelly.
2475,16873065L0,16873065,how the er associated degradation (erad) machinery accurately identifies terminally misfolded proteins is poorly understood.
2476,16873065L1,16873065,"for luminal erad substrates, this recognition depends on their folding and glycosylation status as well as on the conserved er lectin yos9p."
2477,16873065L2,16873065,"here we show that yos9p is part of a stable complex that organizes key components of erad machinery on both sides of the er membrane, including the transmembrane ubiquitin ligase hrd1p."
2478,16873065L3,16873065,"we further demonstrate that yos9p, together with kar2p and hrd3p, forms a luminal surveillance complex that both recruits nonnative proteins to the core erad machinery and assists a distinct sugar dependent step necessary to commit substrates for degradation."
2479,16873065L4,16873065,"when hrd1p is uncoupled from the yos9p surveillance complex, degradation can occur independently of the requirement for glycosylation."
2480,16873065L5,16873065,"thus, yos9p/kar2p/hrd3p acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring correct identification of terminally misfolded proteins by recruiting misfolded forms to the erad machinery, contributing to the interrogation of substrate sugar status, and preventing glycosylation independent degradation."
2481,10803971L0,10803971,"although lactoferrin is known as a basic soluble glycoprotein, the presence of the membrane bound form of this protein has also been demonstrated in human milk."
2482,10803971L1,10803971,"membrane bound lactoferrin was extracted from the human milk fat globule membrane with a detergent mixture of 1% tween 20, 0.5% c12e8, and 0.5 m kcl in 20 mm tris hcl (ph 7.4)."
2483,10803971L2,10803971,lactoferrin in the detergent soluble fraction was purified by affinity chromatography with concanavalin a and by hydrophobic chromatography with phenyl superose.
2484,10803971L3,10803971,the purified protein gave a single band of 80 kda by sds page.
2485,10803971L4,10803971,its n terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that of human lactoferrin.
2486,8089093L0,8089093,"the complete amino acid sequence of sac i, a novel protein inhibitor of blood coagulation produced by streptoverticillium cinnamoneum subsp."
2487,8089093L1,8089093,"cinnamoneum ifo 12852, was determined."
2488,8089093L2,8089093,"automated edman degradation was employed for its fragment peptides, which were obtained by specific cleavage procedures including tryptic, chymotryptic, and peptic digestions, and cyanogen bromide treatment."
2489,8089093L3,8089093,"sac i is composed of 110 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 11,642. it has two intramolecular disulfide bonds, cys31 cys46 and cys68 cys98, but no cysteine residues."
2490,8089093L4,8089093,"the overall sequence homology of sac i is 58% to plasminostreptin, a protein protease inhibitor produced by streptomyces antifibrinolyticus, and 52% to s si, streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor, produced by streptomyces albogriseolus."
2491,8089093L5,8089093,"subtilisin [ec 3.4.21.14] modified sac i, which was prepared by incubating sac i with subtilisin, had a newly generated amino terminal sequence, glu71 trp72 asn73 , in addition to the original amino terminal sequence, and a newly generated carboxyl terminal arginine in addition to the original phenylalanine."
2492,8089093L6,8089093,these results clearly show that the arg70 glu71 bond was specifically cleaved on the limited proteolysis with subtilisin and that the bond is the relative site for subtilisin.
2493,24040305L0,24040305,"in response to infection, macrophages produce a series of inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (no), to eliminate pathogens."
2494,24040305L1,24040305,"the production of these molecules is tightly regulated via various mechanisms, as excessive responses are often detrimental to host tissues."
2495,24040305L2,24040305,"here, we report that inorganic polyphosphate [poly(p)], a linear polymer of orthophosphate ubiquitously found in mammalian cells, suppresses inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps), a cell wall component of gram negative bacteria, in mouse peritoneal macrophages."
2496,24040305L3,24040305,poly(p) with longer chains is more potent than those with shorter chains in suppressing lps induced inos expression.
2497,24040305L4,24040305,"in addition, poly(p) decreased lps induced no release."
2498,24040305L5,24040305,"moreover, poly(p) suppressed inos mrna expression induced by lps stimulation, thereby indicating that poly(p) reduces lps induced inos expression by down regulation at the mrna level."
2499,24040305L6,24040305,"in contrast, poly(p) did not affect the lps induced release of tnf, another inflammatory mediator."
2500,24040305L7,24040305,poly(p) may serve as a regulatory factor of innate immunity by modulating inos expression in macrophages.
2501,19896980L0,19896980,animal models allow insights into complex neurodevelopmental disorders.
2502,19896980L1,19896980,apomorphine susceptible rats (so called apo sus rats) provide a model that displays a complex phenotype with schizophrenia related features and together with its phenotypic counterpart (apo unsus rats) has been independently generated twice (original and replicate rat lines).
2503,19896980L2,19896980,"to understand the molecular basis underlying this phenotype, we here performed mrna expression profiling in various apo sus and apo unsus rat brain regions."
2504,19896980L3,19896980,the expression of only the previously reported aph 1b and the newly discovered kcnip1 (a member of the potassium channel interacting protein family that is known to modulate neuronal channel activity) was significantly different in the apo sus and apo unsus rats from both the original and replicate rat lines.
2505,19896980L4,19896980,"thus, kcnip1 may constitute a novel candidate gene playing a role in the complex phenotype of the apo sus/apo unsus rat model and further studies on this gene are warranted."
2506,23384296L0,23384296,"nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad(+) ) not only transfers electrons in mitochondrial respiration, but also acts as an indispensable cosubstrate for sirt1, the class iii histone/nonhistone deacetylase."
2507,23384296L1,23384296,"however, nad(+) is depleted in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (ir) injury."
2508,23384296L2,23384296,the objective of this study was to investigate the role of exogenous nad(+) supplementation in hypoxia/reoxygenation (hr) stressed h9c2 cardiac myoblasts.
2509,23384296L3,23384296,"firstly, the effects of distinct treating time points and doses of nad(+) supplementation on the viability of hr stressed h9c2 cells were detected."
2510,23384296L4,23384296,"secondly, intracellular nad(+) levels in hr stressed h9c2 cells at various extracellular nad(+) concentrations were determined."
2511,23384296L5,23384296,"thirdly, the role of nad(+) supplementation in hr induced cell apoptosis and its relevance to sirtuin 1 p53 pathway were investigated."
2512,23384296L6,23384296,exogenous nad(+) supplementation elevated intracellular nad(+) level and reduced hr induced cell death in both time  and concentration dependent manners.
2513,23384296L7,23384296,it appeared that nad(+) supplementation exerted the greatest protection when extracellular concentration ranged from 500 to 1000 μm and when nad(+) was added immediately after reoxygenation began.
2514,23384296L8,23384296,"nad(+) replenishment restored sirt1 activity, reduced the acetylation level of p53 (lys373 & 382), and attenuated cell apoptosis in hr stressed h9c2 cells, whereas inhibition of sirt1 activity alleviated the effects of nad(+) replenishment."
2515,23384296L9,23384296,"these results indicated that exogenous nad(+) supplementation attenuated hr induced cell apoptosis, which was at least partly mediated by restoring sirt1 activity and subsequently inhibiting p53 activity via deacetylating p53 at lysine 373 and 382."
2516,12189052L0,12189052,it is thought that disulfide bonds in secreted proteins are inert because of the oxidizing nature of the extracellular milieu.
2517,12189052L1,12189052,we have suggested that this is not necessarily the case and that certain secreted proteins contain one or more disulfide bonds that can be cleaved and that this cleavage is central to the protein's function.

2520,12189052L4,12189052,tumour cells secrete phosphoglycerate kinase which facilitates cleavage of the plasmin disulfide bond(s).
2521,12189052L5,12189052,phosphoglycerate kinase is not a conventional disulfide bond reductase.
2522,12189052L6,12189052,"we propose that phosphoglycerate kinase facilitates cleavage of a particular plasmin disulfide bond by hydroxide ion, which results in formation of a sulfenic acid and a free thiol."
2523,12189052L7,12189052,the free thiol is then available to exchange with another nearby disulfide bond resulting in formation of a new disulfide and a new free thiol.
2524,12189052L8,12189052,the reduced plasmin is then susceptible to discreet proteolysis which results in release of angiostatin.
2525,16809543L0,16809543,"discrimination between splice sites and similar, nonsplice sequences is essential for correct intron removal and messenger rna formation in eukaryotes."
2526,16809543L1,16809543,"the 65  and 35 kd subunits of the splicing factor u2af, u2af65 and u2af35, recognize, respectively, the pyrimidine rich tract and the conserved terminal ag present at metazoan 3' splice sites."
2527,16809543L2,16809543,"we report that dek, a chromatin  and rna associated protein mutated or overexpressed in certain cancers, enforces 3' splice site discrimination by u2af."
2528,16809543L3,16809543,"dek phosphorylated at serines 19 and 32 associates with u2af35, facilitates the u2af35 ag interaction and prevents binding of u2af65 to pyrimidine tracts not followed by ag."
2529,16809543L4,16809543,"dek and its phosphorylation are required for intron removal, but not for splicing complex assembly, which indicates that proofreading of early 3' splice site recognition influences catalytic activation of the spliceosome."
2530,21057569L0,21057569,"doxorubicin (dox) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of several tumors but its cardiac toxicity prevents its use at a maximum dose, representing an important problem."
2531,21057569L1,21057569,increased reactive oxygen species (ros) and imbalance in nitric oxide (no) production have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin.
2532,21057569L2,21057569,hesperidin is a citrus bioflavonoid that possesses a potent antioxidant and no modulating activities.
2533,21057569L3,21057569,"therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of hesperidin against doxorubicin induced cardiac toxicity."
2534,21057569L4,21057569,four groups of animals were used in this study.
2535,21057569L5,21057569,first group served as a control and injected with the vehicle.
2536,21057569L6,21057569,second group was given 200 mg/kg of hesperidin orally for seven consecutive days.
2537,21057569L7,21057569,"the third group was injected with a single dose (20 mg/kg) of doxorubicin intraperitoneally and was sacrificed after 48 h. the fourth group was treated with hesperidin for seven days but on day five, 1 hour after hesperidin treatment, rats were injected with the single dose of doxorubicin."
2538,21057569L8,21057569,"on day seven, the rats were scarified by decapitation."
2539,21057569L9,21057569,"blood was collected and processed for determination of serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), creatine kinase (ck) and no."

2541,21057569L11,21057569,"our results showed that doxorubicin produced severe cardiotoxicity as indicated from increase in serum ldh, ck activities and no level."
2542,21057569L12,21057569,histopathological examination of dox treated rats revealed degenerative changes in heart tissues.
2543,21057569L13,21057569,"the significant decrease in gsh levels, sod activity and increase in tbars levels, indicated that dox induced cardiotoxicity was mediated through ros generation."
2544,21057569L14,21057569,"on the other hand, pretreatment of rats with hesperidin protected cardiac tissues against the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin as evidenced from amelioration of histopathological changes and normalization of cardiac biochemical parameters."
2545,21057569L15,21057569,hesperidin may have a protective effect against dox induced cardiotoxicity.
2546,10611322L0,10611322,"the p53 tumor suppressor protein, a key regulator of cellular responses to genotoxic stress, is stabilized and activated after dna damage."
2547,10611322L1,10611322,"this process is associated with posttranslational modifications of p53, some of which are mediated by the atm protein kinase."
2548,10611322L2,10611322,"however, these modifications alone may not account in full for p53 stabilization."
2549,10611322L3,10611322,"p53's stability and activity are negatively regulated by the oncoprotein mdm2, whose gene is activated by p53."
2550,10611322L4,10611322,"conceivably, p53 function may be modulated by modifications of mdm2 as well."
2551,10611322L5,10611322,"we show here that after treatment of cells with ionizing radiation or a radiomimetic chemical, but not uv radiation, mdm2 is phosphorylated rapidly in an atm dependent manner."
2552,10611322L6,10611322,this phosphorylation is independent of p53 and the dna dependent protein kinase.
2553,10611322L7,10611322,"furthermore, mdm2 is directly phosphorylated by atm in vitro."
2554,10611322L8,10611322,"these findings suggest that in response to dna strand breaks, atm may promote p53 activity and stability by mediating simultaneous phosphorylation of both partners of the p53 mdm2 autoregulatory feedback loop."

this study provides evidence that peroxynitrite may play a role in disc degeneration and discogenic back pain development by an increased synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines."
2577,19407676L10,19407676,nuclear translocation of nf kappab was identified as the potential underlying pathway.
2578,19407676L11,19407676,"therefore, neutralizing peroxynitrite and its derivatives (e.g., via the use of antioxidants) may be a novel treatment option for discogenic back pain."

2580,11459802L1,11459802,these estrogen esters are extremely lipophilic and have prolonged hormonal activity because they are slowly metabolized and slowly release estradiol.
2581,11459802L2,11459802,our previous studies showed that treatment of female rats with clofibrate or gemfibrozil (peroxisome proliferators commonly used as hypolipidemic drugs) markedly stimulated the liver microsomal esterification of estradiol.
2582,11459802L3,11459802,"although clofibrate administration is a potent inducer of liver microsomal fatty acyl coenzyme a:estradiol acyltransferase in rats, it is a poor inducer in mice."
2583,11459802L4,11459802,"in contrast to these observations, wy 14,643 (an exceptionally potent prototypical peroxisome proliferator) is a strong inducer of fatty acyl coenzyme a:estradiol acyltransferase in mice."

2585,11459802L6,11459802,these results demonstrate that induction of acyl coenzyme a:estradiol acyltransferase and acyl coenzyme a:testosterone acyltransferase activities by a prototypical peroxisome proliferator is dependent on pparalpha.
2586,2480122L0,2480122,the amyloid deposited in alzheimer's disease (ad) is composed primarily of a 39 42 residue polypeptide (beta ap) that is derived from a larger beta amyloid protein precursor (beta app).

2594,12926985L4,12926985,the secretory response by the camp pathway (stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide or forskolin) and the camp accumulation in crypts were decreased (p < 0.05) after irradiation.
2595,12926985L5,12926985,"the weak secretory response induced by the cgmp pathway (stimulated by nitric oxide or guanylin) was unaltered by radiation, and the small amount of cgmp determined in isolated crypts from the control group became undetectable in the irradiated group."
2596,12926985L6,12926985,inducible nos was not involved in the hyporesponsiveness to vip after irradiation (there was no effect of an inos inhibitor).
2597,12926985L7,12926985,the secretory response by the ca(2+)(i) pathway (stimulated by carbachol) was unaffected despite a decreased number and increased affinity of muscarinic receptors.
2598,12926985L8,12926985,the non additivity of vip and carbachol co stimulated responses was unmodified.
2599,12926985L9,12926985,"in contrast, vip and snp co stimulation showed that no enhanced the radiation induced hyporesponsiveness to vip through a reduced accumulation of camp in crypts."

2606,11931153L5,11931153,"these include negative biochemical test results for niacin accumulation and nitrate reduction as well as genetic features like the presence of an m. bovis specific mutation in the oxyr locus, absence of the mtp40 sequence and a specific mutation in the gyrb gene, all of which have been described as characteristics for the differentiation of m. bovis."
2607,11931153L6,11931153,"the only obvious biochemical character that differentiates the caprae subtype from other m. bovis isolates is susceptibility to pyrazinamide (pza), which is due to the lack of a single point mutation in the pnca gene."
2608,11931153L7,11931153,"however, susceptibility to pza among clinical isolates of m. bovis isolates has been reported previously and, thus, may now been explained by a pza susceptible subspecies of m. bovis."

2612,12501195L0,12501195,"r67 dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) is an enzyme, encoded by an r plasmid, that confers resistance to the antibacterial agent trimethoprim."
2613,12501195L1,12501195,this homotetramer possesses a single active site pore and exact 222 symmetry.
2614,12501195L2,12501195,"the symmetry imposes constraints on the ability of the enzyme to optimize binding of the substrate, dihydrofolate (dhf), and the cofactor, nadph, resulting in a ""one site fits both ligands"" approach."
2615,12501195L3,12501195,"this approach allows formation of either a nadph.nadph, dihydrofolate.dihydrofolate, or nadph.dihydrofolate complex."

2622,12501195L10,12501195,"from steady state kinetics, addition of q67h mutations does not drastically affect formation of the nadph.dihydrofolate complex; however, a large energy difference between the productive and nonproductive complexes is no longer maintained."
2623,12501195L11,12501195,a role for q67 in discriminating between these various states is proposed.
2624,12501195L12,12501195,"since theories of protein evolution suggest gene duplication followed by accumulation of mutations can lead to divergence of activity, this study is a first step toward asking if introduction of asymmetric mutations in the quadrupled r67 dhfr gene can lead to optimization of ligand binding sites."

2627,19120123L2,19120123,physiological mechanisms of inverted bp rhythm generation are not understood.
2628,19120123L3,19120123,"in our study we determined circadian profiles of plasma hormones related to bp control (aldosterone, corticosterone, melatonin, prolactin) in tgr and control sprague dawley (sd) rats over 24 h and expression of genes encoding catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (th), dopamine beta hydroxylase (dbh), and phenylethanolamine n methyltransferase (pnmt) in adrenals and stellate ganglia."
2629,19120123L4,19120123,plasma levels of corticosterone and aldosterone were higher in tgr than sd rats but acrophases of their rhythms were not changed.
2630,19120123L5,19120123,darktime peak of prolactin in tgr rats was decreased in comparison with sd animals and pineal melatonin levels started to rise earlier in tgr than in sd rats.
2631,19120123L6,19120123,"in adrenals we found upregulated expression of th, dbh, and pnmt mrna at the beginning of the lighttime in tgr compared to sd rats."
2632,19120123L7,19120123,"expression of th and dbh in stellate ganglia was not different in tgr rats in comparison with sd, but pnmt expression was higher during l compared to d in tgr rats."
2633,19120123L8,19120123,we hypothesize that upregulated adrenal medulla functioning in the morning and disturbed communication between circadian oscillators and mechanisms involved in bp control can explain the reversed bp profile in tgr rats.
2634,6431107L0,6431107,abnormally high levels of spontaneous and mitomycin c or diepoxybutane induced chromosome breakage were observed in lymphocytes from eight out of nine previously undescribed patients clinically diagnosed as having fanconi's anaemia.
2635,6431107L1,6431107,the results suggest that the combination of spontaneous and induced chromosome breakage is a good aid in the differential diagnosis and we suggest that increased chromosome breakage is pathognomonic for this recessive disorder.
2636,6431107L2,6431107,"it is, however, not possible to demonstrate consistently raised levels of induced chromosome breakage in obligate carriers."
2637,6431107L3,6431107,the patient who had normal levels of chromosome breakage had an atypical haematological picture and may suffer from a disease genetically different from fanconi's anaemia.
2638,12036278L0,12036278,we developed improved virulence assays for erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 on african violet varieties and devised a new method for the construction of precise bacterial gene knockouts.
2639,12036278L1,12036278,these methods were tested by constructing mutations in genes suspected to be involved with plant interactions.
2640,12036278L2,12036278,the virulence of the hrpg and hrcc mutant strains (both gene products presumed to be involved in protein secretion) was greatly reduced on leaves of semitolerant african violet varieties.
2641,12036278L3,12036278,an hrpn mutant strain produced delayed symptoms on african violet leaves and an hrpn delta pel (delta pel = five major pectate lyase genes deleted) double mutant was nonpathogenic.
2642,12036278L4,12036278,"the hrcc and hrpg mutants did not produce a rapid hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco, unlike the wild type bacterium, and the hrpn mutant gave a reduced hr."
2643,12036278L5,12036278,"the results, therefore, establish the importance of hrp genes in the virulence of e. chrysanthemi and their ability to elicit hr on nonhosts."
2644,12036278L6,12036278,the data also suggest that other effector proteins secreted by the hrp system are required for full virulence and hr elicitation.
2645,22366883L0,22366883,"during the first meiotic prophase in male mammals, sex chromosomes undergo a program of transcriptional silencing called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (msci)."
2646,22366883L1,22366883,"msci is triggered by accumulation of proteins like brca1, atr, and γh2ax on unsynapsed chromosomes, followed by local changes on the sex chromatin, including histone modifications, incorporation of specific histone variants, non histone proteins, and rnas."
2647,22366883L2,22366883,it is generally thought that msci represents the transition of unsynapsed chromatin from a transcriptionally active state to a repressed state.
2648,22366883L3,22366883,"however, transcription is generally low in the whole nucleus during the early stages of the first meiotic prophase, when markers of msci first appear, and is then reactivated globally during pachytene."
2649,22366883L4,22366883,"thus, an alternative possibility is that msci represents the targeted maintenance and/or reinforcement of a prior repressed state, i.e., a failure to reactivate."
2650,22366883L5,22366883,"here, we present an analysis of the temporal and spatial appearance of transcriptional and msci markers, as well as chromatin modifications related to transcriptional regulation."
2651,22366883L6,22366883,"we show that levels of rna pol ii and histone h3 acetylated at lysine 9 (h3k9ac) are low during leptotene, zygotene, and early pachytene, but increase strongly in mid pachytene, indicating that reactivation occurs with some delay after synapsis."
2652,22366883L7,22366883,"however, while transcription markers appear abundantly on the autosomes at mid pachytene, they are not directed to the sex chromosomes."
2653,22366883L8,22366883,"interestingly, we found that chromatin modifications related to transcriptional silencing and/or msci, namely, histone h3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (h3k9me3), histone h3 monomethylated at lysine 4 (h3k4me1), γh2ax, sumo1, and xmr, appear on the sex chromosomes before autosomes become reactivated."
2654,22366883L9,22366883,these results suggest that the onset of msci during late zygotene and early pachytene may prevent sex chromosome reactivation during mid pachytene instead of promoting inactivation de novo.
2655,22366883L10,22366883,"additionally, we found temporal differences between the x and y chromosomes in the recruitment of dna repair and msci markers, indicating a differential regulation of these processes."
2656,22366883L11,22366883,we propose that many of the meiotic defects attributed to failure to silence sex chromosomes could be interpreted as a more general process of transcriptional misregulation that occurs under certain pathological circumstances in zygotene and early pachytene.
2657,21884813L0,21884813,"the 14 3 3 proteins were the first phosphoserine/phosphothreonine binding proteins to be discovered, a finding that provided the foundation for their prominent role in cell signaling."

2659,21884813L2,21884813,"the interaction with 14 3 3 can have a profound effect on a target protein, altering its localization, stability, conformation, phosphorylation state, activity, and/or molecular interactions."
2660,21884813L3,21884813,"thus, by modulating the function of a diverse array of binding partners, 14 3 3 proteins have become key regulatory components in many vital cellular processes   processes that are crucial for normal growth and development and that often become dysregulated in human cancer."
2661,21884813L4,21884813,"this review will examine the recent advances that further elucidate the role of 14 3 3 proteins in normal growth and cancer signaling with a particular emphasis on the signaling pathways that impact cell proliferation, cell migration, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition."
2662,10789893L0,10789893,"we examined apoptosis and expression of p53, e2f 1, bax, bclx(l) and bc12 proteins in two l5178y (ly) murine lymphoma sublines, ly r and ly s, which differ in radiosensitivity and double strand break (dsb) repair."
2663,10789893L1,10789893,both sublines are heterozygous for a p53 mutation in codon 170 that precludes the transactivation function.
2664,10789893L2,10789893,"accordingly, there is no g1/s arrest after irradiation."
2665,10789893L3,10789893,"we found that there is no change in expression of e2f 1, bax, bclx(l) or bc12 proteins in both ly sublines after x irradiation."
2666,10789893L4,10789893,"ly r cells do not constitutively express bc12, whereas both sublines show high bax content."
2667,10789893L5,10789893,radiation induces delayed apoptosis to a greater extent in ly s than in ly r cells.
2668,10789893L6,10789893,"the apoptosis can be seen 24 h after irradiation (2 gy) of ly s cells, with a maximum at 48 h. ly r cells need 5 gy and 72 h post irradiation incubation to show marked apoptosis (identified by the tunel method)."
2669,10789893L7,10789893,the reported observations support the assumption that differential radiosensitivity of ly sublines is associated with the induction of apoptosis that is not related to transactivation by p53 and is primarily related to differential dna repair ability.
2670,1130317L0,1130317,the general trend toward increased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids is apparent in the linoleate level of adipose tissue (13.0 plus or minus 1.3%) and erythrocyte lipids (14.0 plus or minus 1.9%) in the present group of female undergraduate student volunteers compared to values reported in the early 1960's.
2671,1130317L1,1130317,"on the basis of the level of linoleate in their diets (19.5 plus or minus 0.8%), it is also apparent that further increases in tissue lipid linoleate levels are to be anticipated, which in turn will result in an increased requirement for vitamin e. it is suggested that adipose tissue linoleate levels in the general population be used as a baseline for the periodic evaluation and revision of the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin e. the recommended dietary allowance could then be phrased in terms of the quantity of vitamin e activity to be consumed per gram linoleate in 100 g adipose tissue fatty acids."
2672,1130317L2,1130317,a recommendation of 0.6 iu vitamin e activity/g linoleate in 100 g adipose tissue fatty acids is tentatively suggested.

2679,8831929L0,8831929,previous studies have shown that elevated basal homocysteine levels are correlated among family members of patients with coronary vascular disease and juvenile venous thrombosis.
2680,8831929L1,8831929,this suggests the possibility of the presence of inherited basal mild hyperhomocysteinemia (mhh).
2681,8831929L2,8831929,"we studied homocysteine levels, fasting as well as after methionine load, among 96 family members of 21 post load hyperhomocysteinemic vascular index patients, i.e."
2682,8831929L3,8831929,"6 parents, 27 offspring, 38 siblings, 19 uncles and aunts and 6 cousins."
2683,8831929L4,8831929,in 15 out of 21 screened families post load mhh was established in at least one family member.
2684,8831929L5,8831929,"fasting and post load mhh was observed in 19 out of 89 (21%) screened family members (fasting homocysteine levels not measured in seven family members), and 31 out of 96 screened family members (32%), respectively."
2685,8831929L6,8831929,"in 40% of all family members, post load mhh was not accompanied by fasting mhh."
2686,8831929L7,8831929,we conclude that both fasting and post load mhh seems to be inherited in the majority of hyperhomocysteinemic vascular patients.

2690,11554850L3,11554850,"over the 60 min time course of control experiments, these cells do not recover intracellular cysteine despite the availability of cystine (the disulfide of cysteine) in the medium."
2691,11554850L4,11554850,"when cells in spinner culture are provided with exogenous cysteine, they initially concentrate it to 10 fold the extracellular concentration, with the concentration factor decreasing to about 5 fold over the course of an hour."
2692,11554850L5,11554850,"the intracellular gsh concentration changes little throughout this period, regardless of the changes in cysteine levels."
2693,11554850L6,11554850,the same apparatus was used to assess the survival of hct 116 cells irradiated at 37 degrees c under conditions of constant po(2) monitoring.
2694,11554850L7,11554850,"for cells without added cysteine, the oxygen concentration for half maximal radiation sensitivity was about 7.5 mmhg (intermediate hypoxia), more than twice the commonly accepted value (3 mmhg)."
2695,11554850L8,11554850,"at 7.5 mmhg, cells with added cysteine (intracellular concentration 3.5 mm) were almost as radioresistant as severely hypoxic cells (approximately 0.005% oxygen)."
2696,11554850L9,11554850,cells in parallel experiments in which the cells were grown in monolayers on glass petri dishes had intermediate cysteine values and also intermediate radiosensitivity.
2697,11554850L10,11554850,we conclude that the radiation response of cells at intermediate oxygen levels is controlled predominantly by intracellular cysteine levels and that the cysteine levels commonly found in tumors may increase the k(m) for radiosensitivity to values much higher than suggested previously.
2698,17102822L0,17102822,doxorubicin is one of the most active cytotoxic agents in current use.
2699,17102822L1,17102822,it has proven efficacy in various malignancies either alone or combined with other cytocidal agents.
2700,17102822L2,17102822,the clinical usefulness of the anthracycline drug has been precluded by cardiac toxicity.

2707,17102822L9,17102822,"the anthracycline drug has also reduced the cardiac enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione s transferase (gst) and catalase (cat)."
2708,17102822L10,17102822,"besides, it reduced significantly the reduced glutathione (gsh) level, but it increased the total no content in heart tissue."
2709,17102822L11,17102822,prior administration of naringenin ahead of doxorubicin challenge ameliorated all these biochemical markers.
2710,17102822L12,17102822,"taken together, one could conclude that naringenin has a protective role in the abatement of doxorubicin induced cardiac toxicity that resides, at least in part, on its anti radical effects and regulatory role on no production."

2717,12020636L6,12020636,reporter assays also demonstrated reduced ifn gamma stimulated transcriptional activity of the inos and cox2 promoters by cla.
2718,12020636L7,12020636,"consequently, cla decreased the production of pge(2), tnfalpha and the inflammatory agent nitric oxide (no) in raw cells treated with ifn gamma."
2719,12020636L8,12020636,other pro inflammatory cytokines such as il 1 beta and il 6 were similarly decreased by cla treatment of raw cells.
2720,12020636L9,12020636,"in addition, various cla isomers induced hl60 cell differentiation along the monocytic lineage as assessed by measuring expression of the cell surface marker cd14."
2721,12020636L10,12020636,"this differentiation process, as well as the regulation of inos and cox2 by 15dpgj(2), is believed to involve ppar gamma."

2728,631739L0,631739,alcohol feeding (40% of total calories over a period of 9 days) increases microsomal cortisol 5 alpha reductase activity in rat liver distinctly.
2729,631739L1,631739,it is assumed that this is an adaptive response to an increased release of cortisol caused by alcohol administration.
2730,631739L2,631739,"cortisol 5 alpha reductase activity is decreased to one third of control values in rats fed an isocaloric, low protein diet."

2732,631739L4,631739,phenobarbital treatment (80 mg/kg x day) stimulates 5 alpha reduction of cortisol per g of microsomes almost twofold.
2733,631739L5,631739,the activity calculated per total liver increases 4 fold.

2791,12934016L1,12934016,"as increasing amounts of high throughput biological data become available, a major challenge in genomic and computational biology is to develop methods for comparing data from different experimental sources."
2792,12934016L2,12934016,time series whole genome expression data are a particularly valuable source of information because they can describe an unfolding biological process such as the cell cycle or immune response.
2793,12934016L3,12934016,"however, comparisons of time series expression data sets are hindered by biological and experimental inconsistencies such as differences in sampling rate, variations in the timing of biological processes, and the lack of repeats."
2794,12934016L4,12934016,our algorithm overcomes these difficulties by using a continuous representation for time series data and combining a noise model for individual samples with a global difference measure.

2809,10849441L9,10849441,overexpression of prx i and prx ii reduces the amount of h(2)o(2) induced apoptosis measured by these assays.
2810,10849441L10,10849441,these results suggest that prx i and prx ii are involved in the removal of h(2)o(2) in thyroid cells and can protect these cells from undergoing apoptosis.
2811,10849441L11,10849441,these proteins are likely to be involved in the normal physiological response to tsh induced production of h(2)o(2) in thyroid cells.

2817,14978735L5,14978735,the ter of the monolayers remained depressed although both actin and myosin returned to the cytoskeleton by 4 h after the initiation of h(2)o(2) exposure.
2818,14978735L6,14978735,filamentous actin (f actin) staining suggested that the re associating actin took the form of short fibers associated with cortical actin rather than long stress fibers.
2819,14978735L7,14978735,"furthermore, pretreatment with kgf prevented the loss of actin and mhc from the actin cytoskeleton but did not prevent the decrease in ter."
2820,14978735L8,14978735,"these studies suggest that actin disassembly from the cytoskeleton is important in the loss of barrier function, but that it is not the overall amount of actin that is associated with the cytoskeleton that is important, rather it is the contribution this actin makes to the architectural cohesiveness of the cell that contributes to the barrier function."

3021,9361705L0,9361705,the influence of ca2+ on hepatic gluconeogenesis was measured in the isolated perfused rat liver at different cytosolic nad(+) nadh potentials.
3022,9361705L1,9361705,lactate and pyruvate were the gluconeogenic substrates and the cytosolic nad(+) nadh potentials were changed by varying the lactate to pyruvate ratios from 0.01 to 100. the following results were obtained: a) gluconeogenesis from lactate plus pyruvate was not affected by ca(2+) free perfusion (no ca2+ in the perfusion fluid combined with previous depletion of the intracellular pools); gluconeogenesis was also poorly dependent on the lactate to pyruvate ratios in the range of 0.1 to 100; only for a ratio equal to 0.01 was a significantly smaller gluconeogenic activity observed in comparison to the other ratios.
3023,9361705L2,9361705,"b) in the presence of ca2+, the increase in oxygen uptake caused by the infusion of lactate plus pyruvate at a ratio equal to 10 was the most pronounced one; in ca(2+) free perfusion the increase in oxygen uptake caused by lactate plus pyruvate infusion tended to be higher for all lactate to pyruvate ratios; the most pronounced difference was observed for lactate/pyruvate ratio equal to 1. c) in the presence of ca2+ the effects of glucagon on gluconeogenesis showed a positive correlation with the lactate to pyruvate ratios; for a ratio equal to 0.01 no stimulation occurred, but in the 0.1 to 100 range stimulation increased progressively, producing a clear parabolic dependence between the effects of glucagon and the lactate to pyruvate ratio."
3024,9361705L3,9361705,"d) in the absence of ca2+ the relationship between the changes caused by glucagon in gluconeogenesis and the lactate to pyruvate ratio was substantially changed; the dependence curve was no longer parabolic but sigmoidal in shape with a plateau beginning at a lactate/pyruvate ratio equal to 1; there was inhibition at the lactate to pyruvate ratios of 0.01 and 0.1 and a constant stimulation starting with a ratio equal to 1; for the lactate to pyruvate ratios of 10 and 100, stimulation caused by glucagon was much smaller than that found when ca2+ was present."
3025,9361705L4,9361705,e) the effects of glucagon on oxygen uptake in the presence of ca2+ showed a parabolic relationship with the lactate to pyruvate ratios which was closely similar to that found in the case of gluconeogenesis; the only difference was that inhibition rather than stimulation of oxygen uptake was observed for a lactate to pyruvate ratio equal to 0.01; progressive stimulation was observed in the 0.1 to 100 range.
3026,9361705L5,9361705,"f) in the absence of ca2+ the effects of glucagon on oxygen uptake were different; the dependence curve was sigmoidal at the onset, with a well defined maximum at a lactate to pyruvate ratio equal to 1; this maximum was followed by a steady decline at higher ratios; at the ratios of 0.01 and 0.1 inhibition took place; oxygen uptake stimulation caused by glucagon was generally lower in the absence of ca2+ except when the lactate to pyruvate ratio was equal to 1. the results of the present study demonstrate that stimulation of gluconeogenesis by glucagon depends on ca2+."

3040,2248959L2,2248959,"rotation of the peptide plane joining i7 and v8 from its position in the folate complex permits hydrogen bonding of 5 deazafolate's protonated n8 to the backbone carbonyl of i7, thus contributing to the enzyme's greater affinity for 5 deazafolate than for folate."
3041,2248959L3,2248959,"in this respect it is likely that bound 5 deazafolate furnishes a model for 7,8 dihydrofolate binding and, in addition, resembles the transition state for folate reduction."

3050,22162201L6,22162201,"experiments using reporter vectors demonstrated the functional importance of the region  581/+30 of the sost gene, which contains the cpg rich region 1. in vitro methylation of this cpg island impaired nuclear protein binding and led to a 75 ± 12% inhibition of promoter activity."

3052,22162201L8,22162201,"overall, these results strongly suggest that dna methylation is involved in the regulation of sost expression during osteoblast osteocyte transition, presumably by preventing the binding of transcription factors to the proximal promoter."
3053,22162201L9,22162201,"to our knowledge, our data provide first ever evidence of the involvement of dna methylation in the regulation of sost expression and may help to establish convenient experimental models for further studies of human sclerostin."

3066,21539787L2,21539787,"the switching is highly coordinated with a subsecond delay between motors in clear correlation with the distance of each motor from the chemoreceptor patch localized at a cell pole, which would be explained by the diffusive motion of chey p molecules in the cell."
3067,21539787L3,21539787,the coordinated switching becomes disordered by the expression of a constitutively active chey mutant that mimics the cw rotation stimulating function.
3068,21539787L4,21539787,"the coordinated switching requires chez, which is the phosphatase for chey p. our results suggest that a transient increase and decrease in the concentration of chey p caused by a spontaneous burst of its production by the chemoreceptor patch followed by its dephosphorylation by chez, which is probably a wavelike propagation in a subsecond timescale, triggers and regulates the coordinated switching of flagellar motors."

3162,20339550L5,20339550,experiments on wildtype mice established that the host supplied terminal schwann cells (tscs) at the nmjs of transplanted muscles.
3163,20339550L6,20339550,"these results indicate that expression of the mutant protein in muscle is not needed to cause motor terminal degeneration in sod1(g93a) transgenic mice and that a combination of motor terminals, motor axons and schwann cells, all of which express mutant protein may be sufficient."

3172,10414952L8,10414952,our data establish a mechanism for cell type specific transcriptional coregulation of genes required for the synthesis and packaging of the neurotransmitter gaba.
3173,15705869L0,15705869,"searching for a link between inflammation and colon cancer, we have found that the inflammatory mediator leukotriene d(4) (ltd(4)), via its receptor cyslt(1), induces cyclooxygenase 2 expression, survival, and proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells."
3174,15705869L1,15705869,"in conjunction with our previous observation that cyslt(1) receptor expression is increased in colorectal adenocarcinomas, we here found an increased nuclear localization of the cyslt(1) receptor in colorectal adenocarcinomas."

3176,15705869L3,15705869,it was found to be located in the outer nuclear membrane in colon cancer cells and in the nontransformed epithelial cell line int 407 cells by western blot and electron microscopy.
3177,15705869L4,15705869,"cancer cells displayed higher amounts of the nuclear cyslt(1) receptor, but prolonged ltd(4) exposure induced its nuclear translocation in nontransformed cells."

3179,15705869L6,15705869,"in accordance, nuclear cyslt(1) receptors exhibited proliferative extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 signaling."
3180,15705869L7,15705869,the significance of these experimental findings is supported by the observed correlation between the proliferative marker ki 67 and nuclear cyslt(1) receptor localization in colorectal adenocarcinomas.
3181,15705869L8,15705869,"the present findings indicate that ltd(4) cannot only be synthesized but also signal proliferation through nuclear cyslt(1) receptors, stressing the importance of leukotrienes in inflammation induced colon carcinogenesis."

3185,8123589L3,8123589,thp 1 cells expressing antisense mt rna (amt thp 1) had a 30% reduction in mt protein levels.
3186,8123589L4,8123589,"in the absence of lps treatment, amt thp 1 cells demonstrated increased production of h2o2 concurrent with enhanced adherence and invasiveness compared to cells transfected with the control vector (cv thp 1)."
3187,8123589L5,8123589,treatment of amt thp 1 cells with lps depressed these activation associated responses and further reduced the level of mt protein.
3188,8123589L6,8123589,cv thp 1 cells activated by lps produced high levels of h2o2 and adhered to and invaded a reconstituted basement membrane.
3189,8123589L7,8123589,"in addition to increasing cadmium sensitivity, diminished mt levels affected broad ranging processes associated with resting and activated monocyte function."

3201,27318254L1,27318254,"reactive oxygen species can disturb this balance by oxidation of glutathione, which is regenerated using nadph, formed by glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh)."
3202,27318254L2,27318254,g6pdh is regulated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) protein.
3203,27318254L3,27318254,"therefore, we studied the redox status and dna damage in testes and sperm of mice that carried a deletion in atm."
3204,27318254L4,27318254,"the redox status in heterozygote mice, reflected by glutathione levels and antioxidant capacity, was lower than in wild type mice, and in homozygotes the redox status was even lower."
3205,27318254L5,27318254,the redox status correlated with oxidative dna damage that was highest in mice that carried atm deletions.
3206,27318254L6,27318254,"surprisingly, g6pdh activity was highest in homozygotes carrying the deletion."
3207,27318254L7,27318254,these data indicate that defective atm reduces the redox homeostasis of the testis and genetic integrity of sperm by regulating glutathione levels independently from g6pdh activity.
3208,16106266L0,16106266,we previously reported the beneficial effects of combination therapy of interferon (ifn) alpha/5 fluorouracil (fu) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) with tumour thrombi in the major portal branches.

3213,16106266L5,16106266,"immunohistochemically, ifnar2 expression was detected in nine out of 13 (69.2%) patients."
3214,16106266L6,16106266,there was significant difference in the time to progression survival (p = 0.0002) and the overall survival (p < 0.0001) between ifnar2 positive and  negative cases.
3215,16106266L7,16106266,there was a significant correlation between ifnar2 expression and response to ifn alpha/5 fu combination therapy in univariate analysis (p = 0.0070).
3216,16106266L8,16106266,ifn alpha/5 fu combination therapy is a promising modality for advanced hcc with tumour thrombi in the major portal branches and could significantly depend on ifnar2 expression.

3221,22442340L4,22442340,"western blot and northern blot analyses showed that pg201 reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase and cytosolic phospholipase a(2) (cpla(2)) protein expression, but did not affect mrna expression, ultimately resulting in decreased nitric oxide and prostaglandin e(2)."
3222,22442340L5,22442340,"the protein expression of cpla(2) was decreased by pg201 in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translation, suggesting that pg201 may facilitate the degradation of cpla(2)."

3226,2155010L2,2155010,"the skm2 protein is no more homologous to skm1 than to the rat brain sodium channels and differs notably from skm1 in having a longer cytoplasmic loop joining domains 1 and 2. steady state mrna levels for skm1 and skm2 are regulated differently during development and following denervation: the skm2 mrna level is highest in early development, when ttx insensitive channels predominate, but declines rapidly with age as skm1 mrna increases; skm2 mrna is not detectable in normally innervated adult skeletal muscle but increases greater than 100 fold after denervation; rat cardiac muscle has abundant skm2 mrna but no detectable skm1 message."
3227,2155010L3,2155010,these findings suggest that skm2 is a ttx insensitive sodium channel expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle.
3228,10102383L0,10102383,gastrointestinal mucosal blood flow is dependent on a balanced release of vasoactive substances from endothelium.
3229,10102383L1,10102383,nitric oxide (no) may increase the flow by vasodilatation and/or antiaggregation whereas endothelin (et) may decrease it by vasoconstriction and aggregation.
3230,10102383L2,10102383,no and et may have counterbalancing effects on each other in tissue damage.

3232,10102383L4,10102383,lipid peroxidation product measurements and chemiluminescence (cl) studies were also carried out in ileal tissue samples.
3233,10102383L5,10102383,intestinal i/r injury caused an increase in portal venous et levels with levels of 9.4+/ 0.5 fmol/ml in sham operation and 14.8+/ 1.6 fmol/ml in i/r group.
3234,10102383L6,10102383,et level of l name sh group was lower than that of sham operated group and also et level of l name i/r group was lower than that of i/r group.
3235,10102383L7,10102383,this yielded the conclusion that inhibition of no synthesis decreases portal venous et levels in this model.
3236,10102383L8,10102383,increased no production by l arginine caused increased et levels in sham operated groups but this effect was not observed in i/r injury state.
3237,10102383L9,10102383,this study also showed that inhibition of no synthesis has a protective role by reducing the reperfusion damage in this model.

3245,12523726L1,12523726,"the radical reaction model used in this simulator was found to be reasonable, because the results obtained from the simulation of a completely stirred tank reactor (cstr) system were in good agreement with the experimental results, e.g., the concentrations of total organic carbon (toc), hydrogen peroxide and dissolved ozone obtained from a lab scale cstr."
3246,12523726L2,12523726,"furthermore, by using this cfd simulator, the distributions of substances such as hydroxyl radical (oh*) and hydrogen peroxide in the o3/uv reactor have been investigated."
3247,12523726L3,12523726,these distributions showed that this cfd simulator was considered to be reasonable.

3258,11571645L0,11571645,cell cycle withdrawal involves several transcription factors such as e2fs members that play a key role in cell growth control.
3259,11571645L1,11571645,here we describe a novel putative bzip transcription factor isolated from the retina and involved in neuronal proliferation arrest at the terminal differentiation: patf (proliferation arrest transcription factor).
3260,11571645L2,11571645,we show that patf associates with e2f4 protein and interacts with the e2f consensus site.
3261,11571645L3,11571645,patf expression increases with establishment of quiescent state.
3262,11571645L4,11571645,"furthermore, the nuclear patf localization like e2f4, depends on cell growth arrest."
3263,11571645L5,11571645,"the decrease of patf amount, using a retroviral antisense strategy, results in pursued neuroretina cell mitosis."
3264,11571645L6,11571645,our results indicate that patf could be a new molecular signal implicated in the final neuronal cell cycle withdrawal.

3270,21920453L2,21920453,"inflammatory mediators working via intracellular signaling cascades regulate hubs of transcriptional networks that are required for the survival and rapid growth of malignant cells, and number of inflammatory stimuli far exceeds the limited list of transcription factors that they activate."
3271,21920453L3,21920453,"therefore, inhibiting transcription factors that act at the intersections of several deregulated signaling pathways should hold promise for generating anticancer agents."
3272,21920453L4,21920453,this review aims to discuss how inflammation mediated transcription factor interplay could be targeted to develop a more effective therapy against glioblastoma multiforme (gbm)   the most aggressive malignant brain tumor.
3273,15448710L0,15448710,"to understand whether the p53 regulated mdm2 gene expression was altered by the epstein barr virus (ebv) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc), the npc tw01 cell line was infected by ebv through iga receptor mediated endocytosis."

3277,15448710L4,15448710,only the ebv lmp1 but not the ebv lmp2a gene could enhance p53 to upregulated mdm2 expression.
3278,15448710L5,15448710,tumor cells in npc biopsy specimens revealed similar mdm2 expression as in the animal model.
3279,15448710L6,15448710,"it is concluded that although ebv can indirectly enhance mdm2 gene expression in tumor cells that express this gene, it cannot turn on or directly regulate mdm2 expression in cells that do not express this gene."

3312,28088753L2,28088753,"here, we aim to examine whether duration of exposure to ros and/or subcellular ros levels are responsible for the apparently paradoxical effects of oxidants on endothelium."
3313,28088753L3,28088753,we have recently generated binary (tet on/off) conditional transgenic mice (tet nox2:ve cad tta) that can induce 1.8 ± 0.42 fold increase in nadph oxidase (nox) derived ros specifically in vascular endothelium upon withdrawal of tetracycline from the drinking water.
3314,28088753L4,28088753,animals were divided in two groups: one exposed to high endogenous ros levels for 8 weeks (short term) and the other for 20 weeks (long term).

3317,28088753L7,28088753,we also show that short term ros increase induced proliferation in ec and angiogenic sprouting in the aorta.
3318,28088753L8,28088753,"in contrast, long term increase in cytosolic ros resulted in nitrotyrosine mediated inactivation of mitochondrial (mito) antioxidant mnsod, increase in mito ros, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (δψm), decreased ec proliferation and angiogenesis."
3319,28088753L9,28088753,the findings suggest that nox derived ros results in increased mito ros.
3320,28088753L10,28088753,"whereas short term increase in mito ros was counteracted by mnsod, long term increase in ros resulted in nitrotyrosine mediated inactivation of mnsod, leading to unchecked increase in mito ros and loss of δψm followed by inhibition of endothelial function and proliferation."
3321,14704342L0,14704342,the sigmas subunit of escherichia coli rna polymerase holoenzyme (esigmas) is a key factor of gene expression upon entry into stationary phase and in stressful conditions.
3322,14704342L1,14704342,the selectivity of promoter recognition by esigmas and the housekeeping esigma70 is as yet not clearly understood.
3323,14704342L2,14704342,we used a genetic approach to investigate the interaction of sigmas with its target promoters.
3324,14704342L3,14704342,"starting with down promoter variants of a sigmas promoter target, osmep, altered in the  10 or  35 elements, we isolated mutant forms of sigmas suppressing the promoter defects."
3325,14704342L4,14704342,"the activity of these suppressors on variants of osmep and ficp, another target of sigmas, indicated that sigmas is able to interact with the same key features within a promoter sequence as sigma70."
3326,14704342L5,14704342,"indeed, (i) sigmas can recognize the  35 element of some but not all its target promoters, through interactions with its 4.2 region; and (ii) amino acids within the 2.4 region participate in the recognition of the  10 element."
3327,14704342L6,14704342,"more specifically, residues q152 and e155 contribute to the strong preference of sigmas for a c in position  13 and residue r299 can interact with the  31 nucleotide in the  35 element of the target promoters."
3328,7527810L0,7527810,we have maleylated proteins to target macrophage specific scavenger receptors and have used this system to study changes in the epitopes and immunogenicity of such proteins.
3329,7527810L1,7527810,we show that maleylation of diphtheria toxoid (dt) induces targeting to macrophage scavenger receptors and enhances its immunogenicity.
3330,7527810L2,7527810,dt does not evoke detectable serum ab responses upon injection as soluble protein.
3331,7527810L3,7527810,"however, maleylated dt (mdt) does generate a significant ab response."
3332,7527810L4,7527810,"furthermore, immunization with soluble mdt leads to a better t cell proliferative response in vitro than immunization with dt can generate, thereby demonstrating that maleylation leads to enhanced t cell immunogenicity in vivo."
3333,7527810L5,7527810,"we also find that maleylation disrupts the native b cell epitopes of dt and creates new epitopes, because antisera to dt and mdt do not cross react."
3334,7527810L6,7527810,"at least some of the new epitopes generated are maleylation specific, because antisera against various maleylated proteins do cross react."
3335,7527810L7,7527810,"in contrast, maleylation does not significantly modify the repertoire of t cell epitopes generated from dt, because t cells generated by either dt or mdt immunization are cross reactive, and both dt and mdt can stimulate t cells that are specific for single synthetic dt peptide."
3336,7527810L8,7527810,"maleylated proteins are better presented in vitro than are their native counterparts, and this enhancement of presentation is blocked by unrelated maleylated proteins."
3337,7527810L9,7527810,these results suggest that ags targeted to scavenger receptors on macrophages by maleylation are better presented to t cells and are immunogenic in vivo without adjuvant.

3341,19781542L3,19781542,the obtained data recorded that saudi autistic patients have a remarkable higher activities of na(+)/k(+) atpase and high levels of lipid peroxidation compared to control.
3342,19781542L4,19781542,"in addition, they have significantly elevated levels of k(+) and pb(2+) while ca(2+) recorded a significantly lower level compared to age matching control subjects."
3343,19781542L5,19781542,on the other hand both mg(2+) and na(+) were non significantly changed in autistic patients.
3344,19781542L6,19781542,alteration of the selected measured ions confirms that oxidative stress and defective mitochondrial energy production could represent the primary causative factor in the pathogenesis of autism.

3367,29608601L2,29608601,"however, although the tlr7 agonist imiquimod was shown to have antiviral activity in individual patients, no significant effects were observed in clinical trials, and the compound also exhibited significant side effects, including local inflammation."
3368,29608601L3,29608601,"cytosolic dna is detected by the enzyme cyclic gmp amp (2'3' cgamp) synthase (cgas) to stimulate antiviral pathways, mainly through induction of type i interferon (ifn)s. cgas is activated upon dna binding to produce the cyclic dinucleotide (cdn) 2'3' cgamp, which in turn binds and activates the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (sting), thus triggering type i ifn expression."

3377,10659568L2,10659568,"furthermore, we could not detect this isoenzyme in normal individuals."
3378,10659568L3,10659568,"when 100 u/l was used as a cut off value to discriminate between patients with malignant extrahepatic obstruction and the remaining hepatobiliary disorders, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the test were 63 per cent, 84 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively."
3379,10659568L4,10659568,it is concluded that the fast liver isoenzyme could be a useful marker in diagnosis of malignant extrahepatic obstruction.
3380,24719354L0,24719354,bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bm mscs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that differ in size and morphology.
3381,24719354L1,24719354,bm mscs become committed to the osteogenic lineage as senescence approaches and lose multipotency.
3382,24719354L2,24719354,"nevertheless, little is known about the effects of cell cell interaction between different populations on stemness loss and lineage commitment."
3383,24719354L3,24719354,the current study aimed to identify mechanisms by which cell cell interactions between heterogeneous bm mscs affect stemness and lineage commitment of multipotent subpopulation.
3384,24719354L4,24719354,the lineage commitment of primitive multipotent cells was strongly induced in the presence of cytokines secreted by senescent like cells in a cell culture insert system.
3385,24719354L5,24719354,senescent like cells secreted higher levels of interleukin 6 (il 6) than primitive multipotent cells in a human cytokine array.
3386,24719354L6,24719354,il 6 induced the lineage commitment and stemness loss in multipotent cells by decreasing sox2 expression.
3387,24719354L7,24719354,"furthermore, we confirmed that il 6 decreased the transcriptional activity of sox2 through up regulation of runx2 and dlx5."
3388,24719354L8,24719354,"we suggest a mechanism by which il 6 modulates the expression of sox2, resulting in decreased multipotency and causing primitive multipotent cells to undergo osteogenic lineage commitment."
3389,24719354L9,24719354,this is the first study to identify mechanisms in which the cell cell interactions between the different populations play important roles in the stemness loss and lineage commitment of multipotent populations.

3392,14716207L1,14716207,we here demonstrated that disruption of f actin formation by sequestration of g actin with the toxin latrunculin b (lat b) dramatically potentiated lps induced inos mrna and protein expression.
3393,14716207L2,14716207,we also showed that lat b enhanced interleukin 1beta  andbgr;  and tnfalpha induced no production.
3394,14716207L3,14716207,lat b by itself had little or no effect on inos expression.
3395,14716207L4,14716207,cytochalasin d also enhanced lps induced no production.
3396,14716207L5,14716207,lat b dose dependently enhanced lps induced inos promoter activity but had no effect on the stability of inos mrna.
3397,14716207L6,14716207,staining of f actin with nitrobenzoxadiazole (nbd) phallacidin demonstrated that lat b significantly impaired f actin stress fiber formation.
3398,14716207L7,14716207,these data indicate that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton up regulates cytokine induced inos expression via transcriptional regulation.
3399,14716207L8,14716207,further analysis of the signaling pathway from the actin cytoskeleton to inos expression may yield new insight into the mechanism of inos regulation.
3400,12110588L0,12110588,the nuclear retinoic acid receptor rar gamma 2 undergoes proteasome dependent degradation upon ligand binding.

3403,12110588L3,12110588,"the af 2 domain acts via the recruitment of sug 1, which belongs to the 19s regulatory subunit of the 26s proteasome."
3404,12110588L4,12110588,blocking rar gamma 2 degradation through inhibition of either the p38mapk pathway or the 26s proteasome function impairs its ra induced transactivation activity.
3405,12110588L5,12110588,"thus, the turnover of rar gamma 2 is linked to transactivation."

3420,17940334L9,17940334,"consistent with oxidative stress, iron overload increased cardiac malondialdehyde levels, decreased heart glutathione peroxidase (gpx) activity, and increased serum aspartate aminotransferase."
3421,17940334L10,17940334,"taurine ameliorated these changes, but only significantly for liver gpx activity."
3422,17940334L11,17940334,selenium and vitamin e supplementation did not improve oxidative markers and worsened cardiac gpx activity.
3423,17940334L12,17940334,these results suggest that taurine acts primarily as an antioxidant rather than inhibiting iron uptake.
3424,17940334L13,17940334,future studies should illuminate the complexity of these results.

3517,21761294L0,21761294,mrna extraction and subsequent rt polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based expression analysis from laser microdissected material is by now a well established and reproducible method.
3518,21761294L1,21761294,"most routinely stored tissue samples are preserved as formalin fixed, paraffin embedded materials."
3519,21761294L2,21761294,"while this allows for a convenient storage and stable preservation of nucleic acids, deparaffinization before staining for laser microdissection may result in a significant loss of mrna quality and consequently of pcr sensitivity."
3520,21761294L3,21761294,"we describe a method of isolating anatomic compartments from non deparaffinized, formalin fixed, and paraffin embedded tissues by laser assisted microdissection which allows for a highly efficient mrna retrieval."
3521,18340625L0,18340625,"hypothermic machine perfusion (hmp) has the potential to improve recovery and preservation of donation after cardiac death (dcd) livers, including uncontrolled dcd livers."
3522,18340625L1,18340625,"however, current perfusion solutions lack the needed substrates to improve energy recovery and minimize hepatic injury, if warm ischemic time (wit) is extended."
3523,18340625L2,18340625,"this proof of concept study tested the hypothesis that the university of wisconsin (uw) solution supplemented with anaplerotic substrates, calcium chloride, thromboxane a2 inhibitor, and antioxidants could improve hmp preservation and minimize reperfusion injury of warm ischemic livers."
3524,18340625L3,18340625,preflushed rat livers subjected to 60 min wit were preserved for 5 h with standard uw or supplemented uw (suw) solution.
3525,18340625L4,18340625,post preservation hepatic functions and viability were assessed during isolated perfusion with krebs henseleit solution.
3526,18340625L5,18340625,"livers preserved with suw showed significantly (p < .001) improved recovery of tissue atp levels (micromol/g liver), 2.06 +/  0.10 (mean +/  se), as compared to the uw group, 0.70 +/  0.10, and the level was 80% of that of fresh control livers (2.60 +/  0.13)."
3527,18340625L6,18340625,"at the end of 1 h of rewarming, lactate dehydrogenase (u/l) in the perfusate was significantly (p < .05) lower in the suw group (429 +/  58) as compared to ischemia reperfusion (ir) (781 +/  12) and the uw group (1151 +/  83)."
3528,18340625L7,18340625,bile production (microg/min/g liver) was significantly (p < .05) higher in the suw group (280 +/  13) as compared to the ir (224 +/  24) and the uw group (114 +/  14).
3529,18340625L8,18340625,the tissue edema formation assessed by tissue wet dry ratio was significantly (p < .05) higher in uw group.
3530,18340625L9,18340625,histology showed well preserved hepatic structure in the suw group.
3531,18340625L10,18340625,"in conclusion, this study suggests that hmp with suw solution has the potential to restore and preserve livers with extended wit."
3532,3110160L0,3110160,"interaction between the alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and nad+ dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase was detected with a variety of techniques including polyethylene glycol precipitation, ultracentrifugation, and centrifugal gel filtration on a sepharose 6b column."
3533,3110160L1,3110160,"the interaction was specific in that citrate synthase, cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, and nadp dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase did not interact with alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex."
3534,3110160L2,3110160,"the interaction was not inhibited by either 0.1 m kcl or 0.4 m (nh4)2so4, but was completely prevented by 5% glycerol."
3535,3110160L3,3110160,a new method for the preparation of nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase resulted in an enzyme having a protein subunit composition similar to that of classical complex i preparation.
3536,3110160L4,3110160,evidence is given for the existence of ternary complexes containing nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex nad dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex succinate thiokinase.
3537,3110160L5,3110160,these data suggest that a part of the citric acid cycle may be located in the vicinity of nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase.
3538,3110160L6,3110160,these complexes may facilitate the transport of metabolites among these enzymes without their equilibrating with the whole compartment.
3539,10756192L0,10756192,the pathways for selective transcriptional repression of methylated dna templates by the methyl cpg binding protein mecp2 have been investigated using a purified in vitro transcription system that does not assemble chromatin.
3540,10756192L1,10756192,mecp2 selectively inhibits transcription complex assembly on methylated dna but does not destabilize a pre assembled transcription complex.
3541,10756192L2,10756192,mecp2 functions to repress transcription at a distance of >500 bp from the transcription start site.
3542,10756192L3,10756192,the transcription repression domain (trd) of mecp2 will repress transcription in vitro when fused to a heterologous gal4 dna binding domain.
3543,10756192L4,10756192,the trd associates with tfiib.
3544,10756192L5,10756192,"exogenous tfiib does not relieve transcriptional repression established by either intact mecp2 or a gal4 trd fusion protein under these in vitro conditions, nor does the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors."
3545,10756192L6,10756192,we find that the transcriptional repression established by both mecp2 and the gal4 trd fusion protein in vitro also correlates with selective assembly of large nucleoprotein complexes.
3546,10756192L7,10756192,the formation of such complexes reflects a local concentration of dna bound transcriptional repressor that may stabilize a state of repression even in the presence of exogenous transcriptional machinery.
3547,28138058L0,28138058,plant transcription factors generally act in complex regulatory networks that function at multiple levels to govern plant developmental programs.
3548,28138058L1,28138058,dissection of the interconnections among different classes of transcription factors can elucidate these regulatory networks and thus improve our understanding of plant development.
3549,28138058L2,28138058,"here, we investigated the molecular and functional relationships of the transcription factors abscisic acid insensitive 4 (abi4) and members of the basic pentacysteine (bpc) family in lateral root (lr) development of arabidopsis thaliana."
3550,28138058L3,28138058,genetic analysis showed that bpcs promote lr development by repressing abi4 expression.
3551,28138058L4,28138058,molecular analysis showed that bpcs bind to the abi4 promoter and repress abi4 transcription in roots.
3552,28138058L5,28138058,bpcs directly recruit the polycomb repressive complex 2 (prc2) to the abi4 locus and epigenetically repress abi4 expression by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone h3 at lys27.
3553,28138058L6,28138058,"in addition, bpcs and abi4 co ordinate their activities to fine tune the levels of pin formed1, a component of the auxin signaling pathway, and thus modulate lr formation."
3554,28138058L7,28138058,"these results establish a functional relationship between two universal and multiple role transcription factors, and provide insight into the mechanisms of the transcriptional regulatory networks that affect arabidopsis organogenesis."
3555,15248763L0,15248763,"the na,k  and h,k atpases are plasma membrane enzymes responsible for the active exchange of extracellular k(+) for cytoplasmic na(+) or h(+), respectively."
3556,15248763L1,15248763,"at present, the structural determinants for the specific function of these atpases remain poorly understood."
3557,15248763L2,15248763,"to investigate the cation selectivity of these atpases, we constructed a series of na,k atpase mutants in which residues in the membrane spanning segments of the alpha subunit were changed to the corresponding residues common to gastric h,k atpases."
3558,15248763L3,15248763,"thus, mutants were created with substitutions in transmembrane domains tm1, tm4, tm5, tm6, tm7, and tm8 independently or together (designated tmall)."
3559,15248763L4,15248763,the function of each mutant was assessed after coexpression with the beta subunit in sf 9 cells using baculoviruses.
3560,15248763L5,15248763,"the enzymatic properties of tm1, tm7, and tm8 mutants were similar to the wild type na,k atpase, and while tm5 showed modest changes in apparent affinity for na(+), tm4, tm6, and tmall displayed an abnormal activity."
3561,15248763L6,15248763,"this resulted in a na(+) independent hydrolysis of atp, a 2 fold higher k(0.5) for na(+) activation, and the ability to function at low ph."
3562,15248763L7,15248763,these results suggest a loss of discrimination for na(+) over h(+) for the enzymes.
3563,15248763L8,15248763,"in addition, tm4, tm6, and tmall mutants exhibited a 1.5 fold lower affinity for k(+) and a 4 5 fold decreased sensitivity to vanadate."
3564,15248763L9,15248763,"altogether, these results provide evidence that residues in transmembrane domains 4 and 6 of the alpha subunit of the na,k atpase play an important role in determining the specific cation selectivity of the enzyme and also its e1/e2 conformational equilibrium."
3565,24690776L0,24690776,"the larvae of musca domestica (diptera: muscidae) have been used traditionally for malnutritional stagnation, decubital necrosis, osteomyelitis, ecthyma and lip scald and also to treat coma and gastric cancer in the traditional chinese medicine."
3566,24690776L1,24690776,its in vitro antitumor activity and immunomodulatory effect in naïve mice in relation to the traditional uses were also reported.
3567,24690776L2,24690776,"however, the in vivo antitumor effect of this insect and its mechanism of action have not yet been well studied."
3568,24690776L3,24690776,the objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vivo antitumor potential of the peptide fraction from musca domestica larvae (mdpf) and to elucidate its immunological mechanisms.
3569,24690776L4,24690776,the mice inoculated with sarcoma s180 cells were orally administered with mdpf at three doses for 10 days.
3570,24690776L5,24690776,"the effects of mdpf on the growth of mouse s180 sarcoma, splenocyte proliferation, the activity of natural killer (nk) cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls), production and mrna expression of cytokines from splenocytes, and serum antigen specific antibody levels in tumor bearing mice were measured."
3571,24690776L6,24690776,"mdpf could significantly not only inhibit the growth of mouse transplanted s180 sarcoma, but also promote splenocytes proliferation, nk cell and ctl activity from splenocytes, and enhance serum antigen specific igg, igg2a and igg2b antibody levels in s180 bearing mice."
3572,24690776L7,24690776,mdpf also significantly promoted the production of ifn γ and up regulated the mrna expression levels of ifn γ and th1 transcription factors t bet and stat 4 in splenocytes from the s180 bearing mice.
3573,24690776L8,24690776,"however, th2 cytokine il 10 and transcription factors gata 3 and stat 6 were not significantly changed both at transcriptional and protein levels following mdpf treatment."
3574,24690776L9,24690776,mdpf significantly inhibit the growth of transplantable tumor in mice and its in vivo antitumor activity might be achieved by switching on of th1 based protective cell mediated immunity.
3575,24690776L10,24690776,mdpf could act as antitumor agent with immunomodulatory activity.
3576,21421391L0,21421391,mads box transcription factors specify plant meristem identity.
3577,21421391L1,21421391,"in doing so, they determine when floral organs are produced at the shoot apex and control the timing of flowering."
3578,21421391L2,21421391,"the transcriptional activity of key mads box genes is controlled by temperature in many plants, and this synchronises flowering with changing seasons."
3579,21421391L3,21421391,here we review how seasonal temperature variation influences the developmental programme of plants via transcriptional regulation of mads box genes.
3580,21421391L4,21421391,"in particular we examine the role of mads box genes in regulating the acceleration of flowering by vernalization (prolonged periods of cold), using flowering locus c of arabidopsis and vernalization1 of cereals as examples."
3581,21421391L5,21421391,"a potential role for short vegetative phase like genes in controlling winter bud dormancy is also examined, as are potential roles for mads box genes in regulating developmental responses to elevated growth temperatures."
3582,21421391L6,21421391,we conclude that understanding how temperature regulates the transcription of mads box genes provides insight into how seasonal fluctuations in temperature influence plant development.
3583,21421391L7,21421391,plant breeders may be able to use natural variation in temperature responsive mads box genes to breed future crop varieties.
3584,2851728L0,2851728,"several mutant, but not wild type, p53 proteins form complexes with hsp72/73 heat shock related proteins in simian virus 40 transformed monkey cos cells."
3585,2851728L1,2851728,we carried out a detailed biochemical and structural mapping analysis of p53 and report here that p53 hsp72/73 complex formation showed considerable structural specificity.
3586,2851728L2,2851728,"such complexes were remarkably stable, but unlike analogous complexes formed between p53 and simian virus 40 t antigen, they did not form in in vitro association assays."
3587,2851728L3,2851728,p53 hsp72/73 complex formation in vivo appears to be dependent on aspects of mutant p53 protein conformation.
3588,2851728L4,2851728,"however, absence of the conformation sensitive epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody pab 246 was not reliably diagnostic of such complexes, nor was p53 hsp72173 binding reliably diagnostic of oncogenic activation."
3589,10227149L0,10227149,an organosulfur compound was isolated from oil macerated garlic extract by silica gel column chromatography and preparative tlc.
3590,10227149L1,10227149,"from the results of nmr, ir, and ms analyses, its structure was determined as e 4,5,9 trithiadeca 1,7 diene 9 oxide (iso e 10 devinylajoene, iso e 10 da)."
3591,10227149L2,10227149,"this compound was different from e 4,5,9 trithiadeca 1,6 diene 9 oxide (e 10 devinylajoene, e 10 da) only in the position of a double bond."
3592,10227149L3,10227149,"iso e 10 da had antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, and staphylococcus aureus, and yeasts at the concentration lower than 100 micrograms/ml, but gram negative bacteria were not inhibited at the same concentration."
3593,10227149L4,10227149,"the antimicrobial activity of iso e 10 da was inferior to those of similar oil macerated garlic extract compounds such as e ajoene, z ajoene, and z 10 da."
3594,10227149L5,10227149,"from these results, it was suggested that trans structure and/or the position of double bond of iso e 10 da reduce the antimicrobial activity."
3595,11684383L0,11684383,"plasma and tissue alpha tocopherol concentrations are remarkably stable, which suggests that they are regulated."
3596,11684383L1,11684383,"alpha tocopherol transfer protein, tocopherol associated protein, and tocopherol binding protein bind alpha tocopherol."
3597,11684383L2,11684383,"these proteins might function as tocopherol regulatory proteins, although only tocopherol transfer protein has been shown to influence plasma and tissue alpha tocopherol concentrations."
3598,11684383L3,11684383,"tissue alpha tocopherol concentrations likely depend on tocopherol regulatory protein function and tissue lipid content, vitamin e uptake and efflux, oxidative stress, and interactions between vitamin e and other antioxidants."
3599,11684383L4,11684383,"pharmacokinetic models often divide tissues into rapidly perfused, slowly perfused, and very slowly perfused compartments."
3600,11684383L5,11684383,"tissue vitamin e concentrations might equilibrate more rapidly in tissues with greater perfusion, greater vitamin e uptake, increased amounts or activities of tocopherol regulatory protein, and lower lipid contents."
3601,11684383L6,11684383,"the rate at which tissue concentrations approach equilibrium, however, does not predict the final equilibrium concentrations because of redistribution among tissues."
3602,11684383L7,11684383,redistribution of vitamin e to adipose tissue from other tissues may be significant.
3603,11684383L8,11684383,intracellular trafficking of vitamin e might occur in conjunction with membrane recycling because membrane constituents rapidly recycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular endocytic compartments.
3604,11684383L9,11684383,"thus, tocopherol regulatory proteins may modulate rather than directly regulate vitamin e tissue distribution and intracellular trafficking."
3605,8343960L0,8343960,the lin 12 gene of c. elegans and the notch gene of d. melanogaster encode structurally related transmembrane proteins that mediate intercellular signaling.
3606,8343960L1,8343960,we show that truncated forms of these proteins consisting of only the intracellular domains cause cell fate transformations associated with constitutive activity in their respective organisms.
3607,8343960L2,8343960,this activity does not depend on endogenous gene function.
3608,8343960L3,8343960,our results indicate that the intracellular domains of lin 12 and notch have intrinsic activity and that the principal role of the extracellular domains in the intact proteins is to regulate this activity.
3609,8343960L4,8343960,"our results also suggest that equivalent truncated forms of lin 12/notch family members in vertebrates, including known oncogenes, are similarly active."

3616,19179646L6,19179646,"these effects were prevented by losartan, n (2 mercaptopropionyl) glycine, and cariporide."
3617,19179646L7,19179646,"in conclusion, we present data demonstrating that chronic nhe 1 inhibition with cariporide decreases both hypertrophy and apoptosis susceptibility in the spontaneously hypertensive rat heart."
3618,19179646L8,19179646,the antiapoptotic effect would be the consequence of two different actions of cariporide: the prevention of cytosolic na(+) and ca(2+) overload due to the inhibition of the sarcolemmal nhe 1 and a direct mitochondrial effect preventing mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening.
3619,14988380L0,14988380,"progesterone (p4) inhibits apoptosis of rat granulosa cells and spontaneously immortalized granulosa cells (sigcs), which were derived from rat granulosa cells."
3620,14988380L1,14988380,defining the mechanism through which p4 mediates its action has been difficult because these cells do not express the classic nuclear p4 receptor.
3621,14988380L2,14988380,"previous studies have shown that a p4 receptor antibody, c 262, detects a 60 kda protein that is involved in regulating p4's antiapoptotic action."

3623,14988380L4,14988380,this analysis revealed that the c 262 detectable protein is an unnamed protein referred to as rda288.
3624,14988380L5,14988380,this protein has several putative hyaluronic acid binding sites.
3625,14988380L6,14988380,"further hyaluronic acid antagonizes (3)h p4 binding to sigcs and mimics p4's action, whereas exogenous hyaluronic acid binding protein attenuates p4's actions."
3626,14988380L7,14988380,"rt pcr demonstrated that rda288 mrna was present in sigcs, immature rat ovary, lung, and skeletal muscle but was not present in several other organs."
3627,14988380L8,14988380,forced expression of rda288 increased the capacity of sigcs to bind and respond to p4.
3628,14988380L9,14988380,an antibody was also developed against rda288.
3629,14988380L10,14988380,"using this antibody in a western blot protocol, rda288 expression was confirmed in both sigcs and granulosa cells."
3630,14988380L11,14988380,an immunohistochemical study detected rda288 in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane components of granulosa cells of antral follicles.
3631,14988380L12,14988380,immunocytochemical studies on living nonpermeabilized sigcs revealed that rda288 was present on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane.
3632,14988380L13,14988380,"finally, pretreatment with the rda288 antibody blocked p4's antiapoptotic actions."

3634,10438619L0,10438619,dna ring closure methods have been applied to tata box dna and its complex with the tata box binding protein (tbp).
3635,10438619L1,10438619,"the j factors for cyclization (effective concentrations of one dna end about the other) have been measured using cyclization kinetics, with and without bound tbp, for 18 dna constructs containing the adenovirus major late promoter tata box (tataaaag) separated by a variable helical phasing adapter from sequence induced a tract dna bends."
3636,10438619L2,10438619,six phasing lengths were used at three overall dna lengths each.
3637,10438619L3,10438619,cyclization kinetics were also measured in the absence of protein for the same set of molecules bearing a mutant tata box (tacaaaag).
3638,10438619L4,10438619,"the results suggest that the tata box dna itself is strongly bent and anisotropically flexible, in a direction opposite to the bend induced by tbp, and that the mutant taca box is much less bent/flexible."
3639,10438619L5,10438619,"the bending and flexibility of the free dna may govern the energetics of recognition of different dna sequences by tbp, and the intrinsic bend may act to repress transcription complex assembly in the absence of tbp."
3640,10438619L6,10438619,"the cyclization kinetics of tbp dna complexes in solution predict a geometry generally consistent with crystal structures, which show dramatic bending and unwinding."
3641,10438619L7,10438619,"the novel observation of tbp induced topoisomers suggests that this minicircle approach is able to distinguish tbp induced unwinding from writhe (these cancel out in larger dna), and this in turn suggests that changes in supercoiling in small topological domains can control tbp binding."

3645,11880187L3,11880187,"the vegf (+) tumors contained large avascular cavities at days 11 and 21, which were replaced by basement membrane lined channels at day 30. the number of proliferating tumor cells was not significantly different between the vegf (+) and control tumors, but the number of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased in the vegf (+) tumors."
3646,11880187L4,11880187,increased nitric oxide synthase (nos) activity was also observed in the vegf (+) tumors.
3647,11880187L5,11880187,"these findings indicate that vegf contributes to tumor growth through inhibition of apoptosis and increased nos activity, which may be critical during pre vascular stages of tumor development."

3649,12146863L1,12146863,"at adopted catalyst loads the observed kinetic developments are consistent with a non radicalic oxidation mechanism involving the interaction between hydrogen peroxide and 3,4 dhb acid both adsorbed on the active sites of the catalyst."

3652,27254938L1,27254938,"however, candidate gene studies on copd and related phenotypes have not been well replicated."
3653,27254938L2,27254938,research on the genetic pathologic background of copd using genome wide association studies (gwass) has progressed in recent years.
3654,27254938L3,27254938,"the novel candidate genes including chrna3/5 (cholinergic nicotine receptor alpha 3/5), ireb2 (iron regulatory binding protein 2), hhip (hedgehog interacting protein), and fam13a (family with sequence similarity 13, member a) are identified in multiple populations."

3657,11338426L0,11338426,"the objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the genetic variability; and (2) to determine the phylogenetic relationship in the leguminous tree faidherbia albida through out its range of distribution in east, west and southern africa."
3658,11338426L1,11338426,"a total of 16 populations were subjected to enzyme electrophoresis and 6 enzyme systems (adh, mdh, g6pdh, idh, 6pgdh, and alpha est) encoded by 12 loci were scored."

3661,11338426L4,11338426,the average expected heterozygosity (gene diversity index h(e)) was 0.141. all provenances showed significant deviation from hardy weinberg expectation.
3662,11338426L5,11338426,"the upgma cluster analysis, based on modified rogers distance revealed close similarities between eastern and southern african provenances, except debre zeit from ethiopia, which was closest to west african populations than to the east african populations."
3663,11338426L6,11338426,"also, bignona from west africa was peculiarly closer to east african provenances."
3664,11338426L7,11338426,"differentiation of west african populations from eastern and southern african provenances was quite evident, emphasising the clinical pattern of variation in these two major geographical races of f. albida in africa."
3665,11338426L8,11338426,"wright's f statistics showed an overall significant deficit of heterozygotes, a common feature in mixed mating, entomophilous, widespread species such as f. albida."
3666,11338426L9,11338426,the dendrogram analysis showed wide separation among the three ethiopian provenances indicating a high level of genetic differentiation and diversity among them.

3670,11370196L0,11370196,this project attempts to establish a possible link between selected biochemical parameters (cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and levels of malonyl dialdehyde and superoxide dismutase) in soldiers with autoaggressive behaviors.
3671,11370196L1,11370196,"the study involved 33 soldiers treated for self aggressive behavior from july 1, 1998, to june 30, 1999. average patient age was 20.7 years."
3672,11370196L2,11370196,the control group consisted of 21 soldiers hospitalized for mental disturbances but not showing autoaggressive tendencies.
3673,11370196L3,11370196,"total cholesterol and activity of platelets, considering the generation of free radicals and triglyceride concentration levels, were determined in the blood serum of members of both groups."
3674,11370196L4,11370196,the results indicate significantly lower concentrations of total cholesterol in the serum of soldiers showing self aggressive behaviors.
3675,11370196L5,11370196,"also, increased concentrations of malonyl dialdehyde in blood platelets and decreased superoxide dismutase activity were found in individuals prone to autoaggression."
3676,11370196L6,11370196,"the results suggest that the dysfunction of oxidation reduction processes in brain tissue leads to excessive generation of free radicals, which can cause brain cell damage and disturb metabolic processes, resulting in mental disturbances that may constitute a background for self aggressive behavior."
3677,11370196L7,11370196,the decreased activity of superoxide dismutase is a major factor in the observed oxidation reduction disturbances.
3678,16084734L0,16084734,the transgenic mutant superoxide dismutase (sod1) mice and rats have been important tools in attempting to understand motor neuron pathology and degeneration but the mechanism behind death in this model has not been studied.
3679,16084734L1,16084734,"we studied the electrophysiologic and pathologic properties of the cervical motor neurons and phrenic nerves in mutant sod1 rats and demonstrated motor neuron loss, progressive reduction of phrenic nerve compound muscle action potential amplitudes, phrenic nerve fiber loss, and diaphragm atrophy suggesting respiratory insufficiency as a significant contributing factor leading to sod1 rat death."
3680,16084734L2,16084734,"unlike previous observations suggesting that a dying back process may be occurring in the mouse model of the disease, we did not observe differences between proximal and distal axon loss in phrenic nerves of sod1 rats."
3681,16084734L3,16084734,this may reflect a unique feature of respiratory motor neuron biology or may be related to the relatively rapid course of decline in the rat model when compared with the mouse sod1 model.
3682,16084734L4,16084734,significant motor neuron loss was also noted in the lumbosacral spinal cord with relative sparing of motor neurons in the cranial nuclei.
3683,16084734L5,16084734,"taken together, these data suggest that respiratory motor neuron loss results in significant electrophysiologic changes and diaphragmatic atrophy."
3684,16084734L6,16084734,these changes may play a significant role resulting in death of these animals.
3685,24715612L0,24715612,an important epigenetic modification is the methylation/demethylation of histone lysine residues.
3686,24715612L1,24715612,"the first histone demethylase to be discovered was a lysine specific demethylase 1, lsd1, a flavin containing enzyme which carries out the demethylation of di  and monomethyllysine 4 in histone h3."
3687,24715612L2,24715612,the removed methyl groups are oxidized to formaldehyde.
3688,24715612L3,24715612,"this reaction is similar to those performed by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase and sarcosine dehydrogenase, in which protein bound tetrahydrofolate (thf) was proposed to serve as an acceptor of the generated formaldehyde."
3689,24715612L4,24715612,we showed earlier that lsd1 binds thf with high affinity which suggests its possible participation in the histone demethylation reaction.
3690,24715612L5,24715612,"in the cell, lsd1 interacts with co repressor for repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (corest)."
3691,24715612L6,24715612,in order to elucidate the role of folate in the demethylating reaction we solved the crystal structure of the lsd1 corest thf complex.
3692,24715612L7,24715612,"in the complex, the folate binding site is located in the active center in close proximity to flavin adenine dinucleotide."
3693,24715612L8,24715612,"this position of the folate suggests that the bound thf accepts the formaldehyde generated in the course of histone demethylation to form 5,10 methylene thf."
3694,24715612L9,24715612,"we also show the formation of 5,10 methylene thf during the course of the enzymatic reaction in the presence of thf by mass spectrometry."
3695,24715612L10,24715612,production of this form of folate could act to prevent accumulation of potentially toxic formaldehyde in the cell.
3696,24715612L11,24715612,these studies suggest that folate may play a role in the epigenetic control of gene expression in addition to its traditional role in the transfer of one carbon units in metabolism.
3697,4006193L0,4006193,we have developed a cost effective system for performing drug assays by using the cobas bio centrifugal analyzer and emit reagents.
3698,4006193L1,4006193,"with the theophylline assay as a model, we were able to optimize both instrument and chemical parameters to allow assay of 2470 samples with a 100 test emit kit."
3699,4006193L2,4006193,this decreased current reagent costs from +2.00 per test for the syva manual method to 9 cents per test for our proposed method.

3703,11207775L2,11207775,atroseptica (eca) cause strong upregulation of production of exoenzyme virulence factors and motility.
3704,11207775L3,11207775,the hexy gene encodes a novel 14.4 kda protein with no known homologues.
3705,11207775L4,11207775,"the hexy mrna transcript has an unusually long (525bp) 5' untranslated region, which may be important for post transcriptional regulation."
3706,11207775L5,11207775,"an elevated level of transcription of two exoenzyme genes, pelcand celv, was observed in the hexy mutant background."
3707,11207775L6,11207775,"the levels of cellulase and protease in a hexy mutant were independent of the presence of pga, suggesting a role for hexy in the induction of these enzymes seen upon pga addition."
3708,11207775L7,11207775,"electron microscopy revealed that hexy cells were hyperflagellated, perhaps contributing to the hypermotility phenotype of this mutant."
3709,11207775L8,11207775,the hexy mutant m5 exhibited enhanced maceration capacity on potato tubers.
3710,11207775L9,11207775,"therefore, the hexy gene and its gene product may define another level of regulation of virulence determinants in ecc and eca."
3711,28662214L0,28662214,"lung cancers are the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide, with small cell lung cancer (sclc) being the most aggressive type."
3712,28662214L1,28662214,"at the time of diagnosis, sclc has usually already metastasized, and an astonishing 95% of patients eventually succumb to the disease."
3713,28662214L2,28662214,this highlights the need for more effective sclc screening and treatment options.
3714,28662214L3,28662214,"interestingly, the earliest and most frequent genetic alteration associated with lung cancers involves a lesion in the region to which the rna binding protein rbm5 maps."
3715,28662214L4,28662214,"we have recently shown that a decrease in rbm5 expression may be a key step in sclc development, as rbm5 regulated many transformation associated processes in sclc cells."
3716,28662214L5,28662214,"rbm5 is structurally and functionally similar to another rna binding protein, rbm10."
3717,28662214L6,28662214,"both proteins have tumor suppressor properties in a variety of cancer cell lines, and it has been suggested that rbm5 expression can influence rbm10."
3718,28662214L7,28662214,"due to their similarities, and the recent evidence that rbm10 is mutated in up to 21% of lung cancers, we hypothesized that rbm10 would share rbm5's tumor suppressor properties in sclc."
3719,28662214L8,28662214,"using transcriptome analysis and functional assays, we show, however, that rbm10's function was opposite to what we hypothesized; in the endogenously rbm5 null glc20 sclc cell line, rbm10 actually promoted cell proliferation and other transformation associated processes."
3720,28662214L9,28662214,"using rna immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (rip seq) and western blotting, we demonstrate that rbm5 post transcriptionally regulated rbm10 expression via direct interaction with specific rbm10 splice variants."
3721,28662214L10,28662214,we propose a working model describing the impact of this interaction on cellular processes.
3722,28662214L11,28662214,"our results provide evidence that rbm10 expression, in rbm5 null tumors, may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis."
3723,28662214L12,28662214,measurement of both rbm10 and rbm5 expression in clinical samples may therefore hold prognostic and/or potentially predictive value.
3724,10553817L0,10553817,we attempted to develop an insulin administration protocol that maintains normoglycemia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and to study the effects of intraoperative blood glucose management on serum levels of creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme bb (ck bb) and s 100 protein.
3725,10553817L1,10553817,"twenty nondiabetic patients were randomly allocated to receive either ""tight control"" of blood glucose with a standardized iv insulin infusion intraoperatively (group tc) or ""no control"" of blood glucose intraoperatively (group nc)."
3726,10553817L2,10553817,"perioperative serum levels of glucose, ck bb, and s 100 protein were determined in all patients."
3727,10553817L3,10553817,"group tc patients received 90.0 +/  49.2 units of insulin, whereas group nc patients received none."
3728,10553817L4,10553817,"despite insulin, both group tc (p = 0.00026) and group nc (p = 0.00003) experienced similar significant increases in blood glucose levels during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass."
3729,10553817L5,10553817,"however, mean blood glucose level upon intensive care unit arrival was significantly decreased in group tc, compared with group nc (84.7 +/  41.0 mg/dl, range 32 137 mg/dl vs 201.4 +/  67.5 mg/dl, range 82 277 mg/dl, respectively; p = 0.0002)."
3730,10553817L6,10553817,forty percent of group tc patients required treatment for postoperative hypoglycemia (blood glucose level <60 mg/dl).
3731,10553817L7,10553817,substantial interindividual variability existed in regard to insulin resistance.
3732,10553817L8,10553817,the investigation was terminated after we realized that normoglycemia was unattainable with the study protocol and that postoperative hypoglycemia was unpredictable.
3733,10553817L9,10553817,all patients in both groups experienced similar significant increases in postoperative serum levels of ck bb and s 100 protein.
3734,10553817L10,10553817,"these results indicate that ""tight control"" of intraoperative blood glucose in nondiabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery was unattainable with the study protocol and may initiate postoperative hypoglycemia."
3735,10553817L11,10553817,the appropriate intraoperative management of hyperglycemia and whether it adversely affects neurologic outcome in patients after cardiac surgery remains controversial.
3736,10553817L12,10553817,this investigation reveals that attempting to maintain normoglycemia in this setting with insulin may initiate postoperative hypoglycemia.
3737,23108401L0,23108401,"as colorectal cancer remains the second highest cause of cancer related deaths in much of the industrialised world, identifying novel strategies to prevent colorectal tumour development remains an important challenge."
3738,23108401L1,23108401,"bag 1 is a multi functional protein, the expression of which is up regulated at relatively early stages in colorectal tumorigenesis."
3739,23108401L2,23108401,"importantly, bag 1 is thought to enhance colorectal tumour progression through promoting tumour cell survival."
3740,23108401L3,23108401,"here, we report for the first time a novel role for bag 1, establishing it as a suppressor of transforming growth factor β (tgf β1) expression in colorectal tumour cells."
3741,23108401L4,23108401,"microarray analysis first highlighted the possibility that bag 1 may regulate tgf β1 expression, a key cytokine in normal colonic tissue homoeostasis."
3742,23108401L5,23108401,"q rt pcr and elisa demonstrated tgfb1 mrna and protein expression to be significantly increased when bag1 levels were reduced by small interfering rna; additionally, induction of bag 1l caused suppression of tgfb1 mrna in colorectal tumour cells."
3743,23108401L6,23108401,"using reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, a direct association of bag 1 with the tgfb1 gene regulatory region was identified."
3744,23108401L7,23108401,"immunohistochemistry and weiser fraction data indicated that the levels of bag 1 and tgf β1 are inversely correlated in the normal colonic epithelium in vivo, consistent with a role for bag 1 mediated repression of tgf β1 production."
3745,23108401L8,23108401,in vitro studies showed that the change in tgf β1 production following manipulation of bag 1 is functionally relevant; through induction of anchorage independent growth in tgf β1 dependent normal rat kidney fibroblasts and regulation of smad2 phosphorylation in tgf β1 sensitive adenoma cells.
3746,23108401L9,23108401,"taken together, this study identifies the anti apoptotic protein bag 1 as a suppressor of the inhibitory growth factor tgf β1, suggesting that high expression of bag 1 can impact on a number of the hallmarks of cancer, of potential importance in promoting the early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis."
3747,23108401L10,23108401,"establishing bag 1 as a repressor of tgf β1 has important biological implications, and highlights a new role for bag 1 in colorectal tumorigenesis."

3749,12783048L1,12783048,a more mechanistic understanding of no exchange dynamics after exercise is needed to understand the relationship between exercise and no exchange.
3750,12783048L2,12783048,"we measured several flow independent no exchange parameters characteristic of airway and alveolar regions using a single breath maneuver and a two compartment model (maximum flux of no from the airways, j'(awno), pl x s 1; diffusing capacity of no in the airways, d(awno), pl x s 1 x ppb 1; steady state alveolar concentration, c(alv,ss), ppb; mean airway tissue no concentration, c(awno), ppb), as well as serum il 6 at baseline, 3, 30, and 120 min after a high intensity exercise challenge in 10 healthy adults (21 37 yr old)."

3752,12783048L4,12783048,il 6 increased steadily after exercise to 481% +/  562% above baseline 120 min postexercise.
3753,12783048L5,12783048,"high intensity exercise acutely enhances the ability of no to diffuse between the airway tissue and the gas phase, and exhaled no might be used to probe both the metabolic and physical properties of the airways."
3754,8567565L0,8567565,nitric oxide (no) has been detected in the expiratory air of normal animals and human subjects.
3755,8567565L1,8567565,recent experiments revealed that expiratory no production rises during exercise and correlates well with o2 consumption (vo2) and heart rate.
3756,8567565L2,8567565,whether physical conditioning influences expiratory no output production remains unclear.
3757,8567565L3,8567565,"in this study, no concentration in expired gas was measured in 18 healthy male volunteers subdivided into three groups (sedentary, intermediate, and athletic) on the basis of the subjects' state of physical conditioning."
3758,8567565L4,8567565,measurements were taken at rest and during two steady state exercise bouts on a bicycle ergometer designed to elicit vo2 of 1 and 2 l/min with the athletes performing an additional bout at vo2 of 4 l/min.
3759,8567565L5,8567565,"in the sedentary and intermediate groups, expired no concentrations declined significantly with increasing vo2."
3760,8567565L6,8567565,"in contrast, expired no levels declined only slightly with increasing vo2 in the athletes."
3761,8567565L7,8567565,"at a vo2 of 2 l/min, expired no concentrations were significantly higher in the athletes compared with values in the other groups."
3762,8567565L8,8567565,"when correlated with minute ventilation (ve), expired no concentrations declined linearly with the increase in ve in sedentary and intermediate groups but not in the athletes."
3763,8567565L9,8567565,only the athletes had a significant linear increase in no output (expired no x ve) with increasing vo2 (p < 0.001).
3764,8567565L10,8567565,these results support the notion that physical conditioning increases expiratory no output during exercise.
3765,8567565L11,8567565,we speculate that the rise in expiratory no output in the athletes might be due to increased vascular and/or epithelial production of no.
3766,8567565L12,8567565,enhanced vascular no production may be the result of increased shear stress and/or upregulation of endothelial no synthase gene expression.
3767,1524610L0,1524610,the relationship between blood catalase activity and alcohol consumption was investigated in a group of caucasian volunteers (n = 191).
3768,1524610L1,1524610,"subjects individually attended a 1 hr session, during which they were asked to complete the michigan alcoholism screening test (mast) and macandrew scale (mac), supply information on alcohol consumption (averaged over the most recent and typical 30 day periods: recent and typical q values) and other drug use by answering the concordia alcohol screening questionnaire (casq), and provide a 100 microliter blood sample from the fingertip."
3769,1524610L2,1524610,"results showed a significant positive relationship between typical q value and catalase activity (r = 0.43, p less than 0.001), which improved after eliminating multiple drug users from the analysis (r = 0.65, p less than 0.001)."
3770,1524610L3,1524610,"multiple regression analyses showed that catalase activity combined with being male, using cocaine or crack, scoring highly on the mac scale and having alcohol related problems (mast), explained a significant portion of the variance in typical q value."
3771,1524610L4,1524610,these results support the notion that catalase activity is a strong positive determinant of alcohol intake and support the hypothesis that the enzyme catalase plays a role in regulating voluntary ethanol consumption.

3777,12376162L5,12376162,immediately after the injection tail flick reflex latency was measured.
3778,12376162L6,12376162,"stressed animals were submitted to 2 h of restraint and tested immediately or 1, 2, 5 or 10 days later."
3779,12376162L7,12376162,l name failed to modify nociception in nonstressed rats.
3780,12376162L8,12376162,"however, 5 days after, restraint l name, at all doses tested, produced an antinociceptive effect (anova, p<.05)."
3781,12376162L9,12376162,the dose response curve had an inverted u shape.
3782,12376162L10,12376162,"l name antinociceptive effect was antagonized by previous treatment with l arginine (150 nmol/0.2 microl, p<.05)."
3783,12376162L11,12376162,the results suggest that the modulation of nociceptive processes by no in the dorsal hippocampus is dependent on previous stress exposure and on poststress interval.
3784,6123886L0,6123886,a case control study was conducted to investigate the association between serum selenium and risk of death from acute coronary heart disease (chd) as well as risk of fetal and non fetal myocardial infarction (mi).
3785,6123886L1,6123886,"case control pairs came from a population of 11,000 persons examined in 1972 from two counties in eastern finland, an area with an exceptionally high mortality from cardiovascular diseases."
3786,6123886L2,6123886,cases were aged 35 59 years and had died of chd or other cvd or had a non fetal mi during a seven year follow up.
3787,6123886L3,6123886,"controls were matched for sex, age, daily tobacco consumption, serum cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, and history of angina pectoris."
3788,6123886L4,6123886,the mean serum selenium concentration for all cases was 51.8 micrograms/l and for all controls 55.3 micrograms/l (p less than 0.01).
3789,6123886L5,6123886,"serum selenium of less than 45 micrograms/l was associated with an adjusted relative risk of chd death of 2.9 (p less than 0.01, 95% ci, 1.4 6.0), a relative risk of cvd death of 2.2 (p less than 0.01, 95% ci, 1.2 4.0), and a relative risk of fatal and nonfatal mi of 2.1 (p less than 0.001, 95% ci, 1.4 3.1)."
3790,6123886L6,6123886,"22% (95% ci, 8 35%) of contrary deaths were attributable to serum selenium in the whole study population."
3791,11988104L0,11988104,"sulphoraphane (sf), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate, is a potent anticarcinogen in animal experiments."
3792,11988104L1,11988104,"the mechanism of action of sulphoraphane includes induction of phase 2 detoxification enzymes, inhibition of carcinogen activating phase 1 enzymes, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and anti inflammation."
3793,11988104L2,11988104,"we have recently found that it was accumulated in mammalian cells by up to several hundred fold over the extracellular concentration, primarily by conjugation with intracellular gsh."
3794,11988104L3,11988104,the intracellular accumulation levels of sf can reach millimolar concentrations.
3795,11988104L4,11988104,the anticarcinogenic activity of sf is at least partly dependent on its accumulation levels in cells.
3796,11988104L5,11988104,"here we show, however, that the accumulated sf was rapidly exported mainly in the form of gsh conjugate (gs sf) in cultured human cells."
3797,11988104L6,11988104,it appeared that to sustain the intracellular accumulation levels required a continuous uptake of sf to offset the rapid export of sf/gs sf.
3798,11988104L7,11988104,these findings may have important implications for the development of an effective dosing regimen for sf.
3799,11988104L8,11988104,"moreover, the export was temperature sensitive and was inhibited by known inhibitors of membrane pumps, suggesting the involvement of such a pump in exporting accumulated sf/gs sf."
3800,11988104L9,11988104,"indeed, studies with human leukemia cells (hl60) with or without overexpression of multidrug resistance associated protein 1(mrp 1) and human myeloma cells (8226) with or without overexpression of p glycoprotein 1 (pgp 1) indicated that both mrp 1 and pgp 1 are involved in the export of intracellular sf/gs sf."
3801,8870840L0,8870840,the effects of angiotensin ii (atii) administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)
3802,8870840L1,8870840,at a dose of 0.5 microgram per mouse on the activity of monoamine oxidase a (mao a) and monoamine oxidase b (mao b) in the forebrain of normoxic and hypoxic mice were studied.
3803,8870840L2,8870840,the influence of hypoxia (asphyctic and haemic) on mao a and mao b activity was also investigated.
3804,8870840L3,8870840,mao a activity was increased in haemic hypoxia; mao b activity increased in both asphyctic and haemic hypoxia.
3805,8870840L4,8870840,atii increased mao a activity without affecting mao b activity under normoxic conditions.
3806,8870840L5,8870840,atii increased mao a activity but decreased mao b in hypoxic (asphyctic) mice as compared to normoxic controls.
3807,8870840L6,8870840,the results suggest the role of mao a and mao b in the atii induced increase of susceptibility to acute hypoxia.
3808,6966941L0,6966941,the effects of cobalt and copper o phenanthroline complexes on electron transfer and energy coupling activity in the reaction center and chromatophore preparations of purple bacteria were studied.
3809,6966941L1,6966941,"in terms of their effects on the systems under study these complexes fall into two groups, i.e."
3810,6966941L2,6966941,"cobalt complexes with a high electron transfer activity, which stimulate membrane energization, and copper complexes which contribute to the chromatophore membrane deenergization."
3811,6966941L3,6966941,"among a variety of complexes studied the perchlorate tris o phenanthroline complex co(ii) and the chloride 4,7 diphenyl o phenanthroline complex cu(ii) were found to have the highest activity."
3812,6966941L4,6966941,both cobalt and copper o phenanthroline complexes may be a promising tool for regulating bioenergetic processes.
3813,27664420L0,27664420,"lamp1 and lamp2 proteins are highly abundant, ubiquitous, mammalian proteins that line the lysosome limiting membrane, and protect it from lysosomal hydrolase action."
3814,27664420L1,27664420,"lamp2 deficiency causes danon's disease, an x linked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
3815,27664420L2,27664420,"lamp2 is needed for chaperone mediated autophagy, and its expression improves tissue function in models of aging."
3816,27664420L3,27664420,we show here that human lamp1 and lamp2 bind cholesterol in a manner that buries the cholesterol 3β hydroxyl group; they also bind tightly to npc1 and npc2 proteins that export cholesterol from lysosomes.
3817,27664420L4,27664420,"quantitation of cellular lamp2 and npc1 protein levels suggest that lamp proteins represent a significant cholesterol binding site at the lysosome limiting membrane, and may signal cholesterol availability."
3818,27664420L5,27664420,functional rescue experiments show that the ability of human lamp2 to facilitate cholesterol export from lysosomes relies on its ability to bind cholesterol directly.
3819,20847284L0,20847284,"nitric oxide (no), which is derived from endothelial no synthase (enos), provides crucial signals for angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment."
3820,20847284L1,20847284,tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) is an absolute requirement for enos activity.
3821,20847284L2,20847284,"in this study, we investigated whether this activation is both maintained by a wild type ras/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (pi3k)/akt positive feedback loop in endothelial cells and affects tumor angiogenesis."
3822,20847284L3,20847284,"we found that supplementation of bh4 (via the pterin salvage pathway with sep) increased akt/enos phosphorylation in both human enos transfected cos 7 cells and endothelial cells concomitant with increases in no production, cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation."
3823,20847284L4,20847284,this augmentation was abrogated by a pi3k inhibitor.
3824,20847284L5,20847284,"sepiapterin (sep) also increased gtp bound wild type ras and pi3k/akt/enos activation, which was prevented by the enos inhibitor, nω nitro l arginine methyl ester (l name)."
3825,20847284L6,20847284,"furthermore, expression of gtp cyclohydrolase i (the rate limiting enzyme in de novo bh4 synthesis) under doxycycline control potentiated in vivo tumorigenesis, tumor cell proliferation, as well as angiogenesis."
3826,20847284L7,20847284,"conversely, both switching off gtp cyclohydrolase i expression as well as inhibiting its enzymatic activity significantly decreased enos expression and tumor vascularization."
3827,20847284L8,20847284,"this study demonstrates an important role for bh4 synthesis in angiogenesis by the activation of enos for no production, which is maintained by a pi3k/akt positive feedback loop through effects on wild type ras in endothelial cells."
3828,20847284L9,20847284,our findings suggest that bh4 synthesis may be a rational target for antiangiogenesis therapy for tumors.
3829,19352043L0,19352043,athletes become increasingly susceptible to infection with intense training that results in immune suppression.
3830,19352043L1,19352043,"the immune state was investigated after administering cystine/theanine (ct), which has been reported to have an immune reinforcement effect, to athletes before training involving a prolonged period of intense exercise."
3831,19352043L2,19352043,"fifteen long distance runners were each allocated to the ct or placebo group, and the test food was ingested for 10 d prior to the start of training."
3832,19352043L3,19352043,clinical examinations were performed before and after the training.
3833,19352043L4,19352043,"the results indicate a significant increase in the high sensitivity c reactive protein (hs crp) and neutrophil count in the blood, as well as a decreasing tendency for lymphocytes in the placebo group, but not the ct group."
3834,19352043L5,19352043,"these observations suggest that the ingestion of ct contributed to suppressing the change in inflammatory response, prevented a decrease in the immune function, and prevented infection and reduced symptoms when infected associated with continuous intense exercise."
3835,3524680L0,3524680,l 3 glycerophosphate dehydrogenase was purified from porcine brain mitochondria by a shorter and simpler procedure than previously reported.
3836,3524680L1,3524680,immunoblotting with antiserum to the porcine enzyme established that rat liver l 3 glycerophosphate dehydrogenase has the same mr (76 000) by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
3837,3524680L2,3524680,"in liver mitochondria from normal and hyperthyroid rats, changes in l 3 glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity were parallelled by changes in enzyme content assayed by immunoblotting."
3838,3524680L3,3524680,"similar changes were found in the amount of enzyme synthesised in vitro by reticulocyte lysate programmed with rat liver mrna, suggesting that thyroid hormone causes specific induction of l 3 glycerophosphate dehydrogenase mrna."
3839,26686189L0,26686189,human epidemiological studies showed that radon and arsenic exposures are major risk factors for lung cancer in yunnan tin miners.
3840,26686189L1,26686189,"however, biological evidence for this phenomenon is absent."
3841,26686189L2,26686189,"in this study, hbe cells were exposed to different concentrations of sodium arsenite, different radon exposure times, or a combination of these two factors."
3842,26686189L3,26686189,the results showed a synergistic effect of radon and sodium arsenite in cell cytotoxicity as determined by cell viability.
3843,26686189L4,26686189,elevated intracellular ros levels and increased dna damage indexed by comet assay and γ h2ax were detected.
3844,26686189L5,26686189,"moreover, dna hr repair in terms of rad51 declined when the cells were exposed to both radon and sodium arsenite."
3845,26686189L6,26686189,the synergistic effect of radon and sodium arsenite in hbe cells may be attributed to the enhanced dsbs and inhibited hr pathway upon co exposure.
3846,19487692L0,19487692,"serine proteinases in insect plasma have been implicated in two types of immune responses; that is, activation of prophenoloxidase (propo) and activation of cytokine like proteins."
3847,19487692L1,19487692,"we have identified more than 20 serine proteinases in hemolymph of the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta, but functions are known for only a few of them."
3848,19487692L2,19487692,"we report here functions of two additional m. sexta proteinases, hemolymph proteinases 6 and 8 (hp6 and hp8)."
3849,19487692L3,19487692,hp6 and hp8 are each composed of an amino terminal clip domain and a carboxyl terminal proteinase domain.
3850,19487692L4,19487692,"hp6 is an apparent ortholog of drosophila persephone, whereas hp8 is most similar to drosophila and tenebrio spätzle activating enzymes, all of which activate the toll pathway."
3851,19487692L5,19487692,"prohp6 and prohp8 are expressed constitutively in fat body and hemocytes and secreted into plasma, where they are activated by proteolytic cleavage in response to infection."
3852,19487692L6,19487692,"to investigate activation and biological activity of hp6 and hp8, we purified recombinant prohp8, prohp6, and mutants of prohp6 in which the catalytic serine was replaced with alanine, and/or the activation site was changed to permit activation by bovine factor xa."
3853,19487692L7,19487692,hp6 was found to activate propo activating proteinase (propap1) in vitro and induce propo activation in plasma.
3854,19487692L8,19487692,hp6 was also determined to activate prohp8.
3855,19487692L9,19487692,"active hp6 or hp8 injected into larvae induced expression of antimicrobial peptides and proteins, including attacin, cecropin, gloverin, moricin, and lysozyme."
3856,19487692L10,19487692,"our results suggest that prohp6 becomes activated in response to microbial infection and participates in two immune pathways; activation of pap1, which leads to propo activation and melanin synthesis, and activation of hp8, which stimulates a toll like pathway."
3857,18211801L0,18211801,"git1 is an adaptor protein, which links signaling proteins to focal adhesion, thereby regulating cytoskeletal reorganization."
3858,18211801L1,18211801,"platelets undergo dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization during platelet activation, for which a large number of adaptor proteins are required."
3859,18211801L2,18211801,"however, there has been no report of git1 in platelets."
3860,18211801L3,18211801,"we found that git1 was abundantly expressed in platelets and underwent tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of integrin alpha(iib)beta(3), which was inhibited by the src kinase inhibitor pp2."
3861,18211801L4,18211801,"furthermore, git1 constitutively associated with betapix, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (gef) for rac."
3862,18211801L5,18211801,"the git1/betapix complex associated with alpha(iib)beta(3), concomitantly with git1 tyrosine phosphorylation."
3863,18211801L6,18211801,"moreover, both git1 and alpha(iib)beta(3) rapidly translocated to the cytoskeletal fraction during platelet aggregation, which was not observed in the absence of aggregation."
3864,18211801L7,18211801,these results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of git1 by src kinases may regulate cytoskeletal reorganization downstream of alpha(iib)beta(3) by bringing the rac gef betapix to the vicinity of the integrin.
3865,20509331L0,20509331,the present study was designed to assess the levels of advanced oxidation protein products (aopp) and percent hemolysis (that indirectly indicates the degree of membrane damage secondary to lipid peroxidation) in colorectal carcinoma.
3866,20509331L1,20509331,"glutathione (gsh), total thiols and albumin were measured to determine the antioxidant status."
3867,20509331L2,20509331,"considering the dynamic interaction between various antioxidants in the body, we measured the total antioxidant activity (aoa)."
3868,20509331L3,20509331,globulin was measured to assess the inflammatory response secondary to oxidative stress.
3869,20509331L4,20509331,investigations were conducted in 45 cases of recently diagnosed primary colorectal adenocarcinoma.
3870,20509331L5,20509331,"as control, 45 age and sex matched healthy persons were chosen."
3871,20509331L6,20509331,"gsh was estimated in whole blood, percent hemolysis in rbc suspension and other parameters in plasma."
3872,20509331L7,20509331,"we observed a very high significant increase (p<0.001) in aopp, percent hemolysis and a highly significant increase (p<0.01) in globulin in colorectal carcinoma."
3873,20509331L8,20509331,"we observed a very high significant decrease (p<0.001) in whole blood gsh, total thiols, albumin, aoa and a significant decrease (p<0.05) in plasma gsh in colorectal carcinoma."
3874,20509331L9,20509331,a very high significant negative correlation between percent hemolysis and aoa and an apparent negative correlation between total thiols and aopp was seen in colorectal carcinoma.
3875,20509331L10,20509331,"this demonstrated oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant status and secondary inflammatory response in colorectal carcinoma."
3876,9500184L0,9500184,we and others have previously shown that dietary fat can alter the growth and metastasis of rodent mammary tumors.
3877,9500184L1,9500184,few transplantable tumor models have been used to study the effects of dietary n 6 versus n 3 fatty acids on mammary tumorigenesis.
3878,9500184L2,9500184,here we study the effects of fish oil and safflower oil on the growth and metastasis of an animal model that in several ways parallels the human disease.
3879,9500184L3,9500184,"tumor latency, growth and metastasis were studied in mice fed diets that contained either 10 or 20% total fat which was varied in the type of fat with either menhaden fish oil (fo), safflower oil (so) or a 50/50 mixture of the two."
3880,9500184L4,9500184,tumor latency was significantly longer and tumor growth was significantly slower in mice fed the 20% fo diet.
3881,9500184L5,9500184,"when spontaneous metastasis was assessed, mice fed diets containing fo had significantly decreased numbers of pulmonary nodules and total metastatic load."
3882,9500184L6,9500184,"likewise, mice fed fo diets had a lower level of implantation and survival of pulmonary metastases."
3883,9500184L7,9500184,"thus, in our animal model, diets containing n 3 fatty acids in fish oil significantly decrease primary breast tumor growth and its metastasis."
3884,24840576L0,24840576,phthalocyanines are excellent photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy as they have strong absorbance in the near infra red region which is most relevant for in vivo activation in deeper tissular regions.
3885,24840576L1,24840576,"however, most phthalocyanines present two major challenges, ie, a strong tendency to aggregate and low water solubility, limiting their effective usage clinically."
3886,24840576L2,24840576,"in the present study, we evaluated the potential enhancement capability of glycerol substitution on the photodynamic properties of zinc (ii) phthalocyanines (znpc)."
3887,24840576L3,24840576,"three glycerol substituted znpc, 1 3, (tetra peripherally, tetra non peripherally and mono iodinated tri non peripherally respectively) were evaluated in terms of their spectroscopic properties, rate of singlet oxygen generation, partition coefficient (log p), intracellular uptake, photo induced cytotoxicity and vascular occlusion efficiency."
3888,24840576L4,24840576,tetrasulfonated znpc (znpcs4) was included as a reference compound.
3889,24840576L5,24840576,"here, we showed that 1 3 exhibited 10 100 nm red shifted absorption peaks with higher molar absorptivity, and at least two fold greater singlet oxygen generation rates compared to znpcs4."
3890,24840576L6,24840576,"meanwhile, phthalocyanines 1 and 2 showed more hydrophilic log p values than 3 consistent with the number of glycerol attachments but 3 was most readily taken up by cells compared to the rest."
3891,24840576L7,24840576,"both phthalocyanines 2 and 3 exhibited potent phototoxicity against mcf 7, hct 116 and hsc 2 cancer cell lines with ic50 ranging 2.8 3.2 µm and 0.04 0.06 µm respectively, while 1 and znpcs4 (up to 100 µm) failed to yield determinable ic50 values."
3892,24840576L8,24840576,"in terms of vascular occlusion efficiency, phthalocyanine 3 showed better effects than 2 by causing total occlusion of vessels with diameter <70 µm of the chorioallantoic membrane."
3893,24840576L9,24840576,"meanwhile, no detectable vascular occlusion was observed for znpcs4 with treatment under similar experimental conditions."
3894,24840576L10,24840576,"these findings provide evidence that glycerol substitution, in particular in structures 2 and 3, is able to improve the photodynamic properties of znpc."
3895,20556584L0,20556584,"this study examined the association of expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), a promoter of angiogenesis, with endothelium dysfunction in preeclampsia."
3896,20556584L1,20556584,"the level of vegf protein and mrna in the placenta and peripheral blood samples of 30 preeclampsia patients and 30 normotensive pregnant women was measured by immunohistochemistry, real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt pcr) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), respectively."
3897,20556584L2,20556584,vegf expression in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) was blocked by small interfering rnas (sirnas).
3898,20556584L3,20556584,the monolayer barrier function of huvecs was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of bsa that crossed the huvec monolayers.
3899,20556584L4,20556584,"the cell proliferation and cell secreted nitric oxide (no) level were detected by mtt method and nitrate reductase assay, respectively."
3900,20556584L5,20556584,the results showed that vegf was expressed in the syncytiotrophoblasts and endothelial cells of vessels and capillaries in the placenta tissue.
3901,20556584L6,20556584,"the serum level of vegf in the preeclampsia patients was significantly decreased as compared with that in normal pregnant subjects, although vegf mrna expression in the placenta tissue of preeclampsia patients remained still high."
3902,20556584L7,20556584,"moreover, vegf deficit could lead to endothelium cell dysfunction, and the administration of vegf could protect endothelium cells from injury."
3903,20556584L8,20556584,"it was concluded that lack of vegf contributes to endothelium dysfunction, which may lead to the occurrence and development of preeclampsia."
3904,6713073L0,6713073,purple membrane suspension shows two different orientations in electric fields of different frequencies.
3905,6713073L1,6713073,"the orientation at low frequencies (less than or equal to approximately 10 hz), with the membrane surface perpendicular to the electric field, is due to permanent dipole moment of the membrane and the orientation at high frequencies (greater than or equal to approximately 100 hz), with the surface parallel to the electric field, is due to induced dipole moment."
3906,6713073L2,6713073,"by quantitative analysis of these orientations, we determined the permanent dipole moment and the polarizability."
3907,6713073L3,6713073,both values varied according to the membrane size: the permanent dipole moment ranged from 500 kd to 10 md and was proportional to the square of the diameter of the membrane.
3908,6713073L4,6713073,the polarizability ranged from 1 x 10( 13) to 1 x 10( 11)cm3 and was proportional to the third to fourth power of the diameter.
3909,6713073L5,6713073,"because the permanent dipole moment was proportional to the area of the membrane, we could determine permanent dipole moment per bacteriorhodopsin."
3910,6713073L6,6713073,"by determining the actual membrane size under electron microscopy, we got 98 d/bacteriorhodopsin."

3912,6713073L8,6713073,"these values, however, were strongly dependent on the ionic strength in the medium, suggesting a screening effect due to counter ions near the membrane surface."
3913,6713073L9,6713073,we evaluated the screening effect and showed about a four charge difference between the two sides of the purple membrane.
3914,6713073L10,6713073,"under illumination, we found that the permanent dipole moment decreased from 98 to 63 d/bacteriorhodopsin."

3923,28446294L1,28446294,the resistant cell line rpmi 8226/r of multiple myeloma was established by an ascending concentration gradient method.
3924,28446294L2,28446294,"the experiment consisted of 4 groups: rpmi8226/r, rpmi8226/s, gant61+rpmi8226/r and gant61+rpmi8226/s."
3925,28446294L3,28446294,"the cck 8 (cell counting kit 8) assay was used to detect the cell proliferation inhibition rate in 4 groups; the rt pcr was used to detect the expression of gli1, gli2, shh, ihh, smo and sufu in the rpmi8226/s and rpmi8226/r cells."
3926,28446294L4,28446294,"the western blot was used to detect the expression of the resistant protein cyclin d1, p21 and bcl 2 and mdr related signaling pathways protein p akt, p mapk and stat3 in the rpmi8226/s and rpmi8226/r cells."
3927,28446294L5,28446294,"after adding different concentration of gant61, the western blot was used to detect the expression of gli2 in rpmi8226/r and rpmi8226/s cells."
3928,28446294L6,28446294,"the expression of shh, ihh, smo gli2 was enhanced significantly in the rpmi8226/r cells, but the expression of sufu inhibitor was reduced, the expression level of related protein in hedgehog signaling pathway was significanly higher in rpmi8226/r than that in rpmi8226/s."
3929,28446294L7,28446294,"after theatment of gant61 in vitro, the expression level of gli2 in multiple myelom cells obviously decreased, the decreasing effect of gant61 on gli2 expression in rpmi8226/r cells was more significant than that in rpmi8226/s cells."

3931,21854546L0,21854546,delayed wound healing in diabetes is a challenging medical and societal problem for which there is currently no efficacious treatment.
3932,21854546L1,21854546,one of the major contributors of this problem is nitric oxide (no) deficiency.
3933,21854546L2,21854546,no is a critical signalling molecule essential for normal wound repair.
3934,21854546L3,21854546,"sustained hyperglycaemia in diabetes leads to increased vascular superoxide production, which inactivates no and causes vascular dysfunction."
3935,21854546L4,21854546,new therapeutic regiments and strategies to enhance endothelial no production are a new hope to improve impaired diabetic wound healing.
3936,21854546L5,21854546,one of the agents that have the ability to improve endothelial no generation in diabetic patients is folic acid.
3937,21854546L6,21854546,"folic acid ability to conserve no bioactivity may be due to homocysteine lowering effects of folates, antioxidant actions and effects on cofactor availability."
3938,21854546L7,21854546,"considering these data, we hypothesised that folic acid supplementation may ameliorate delayed diabetic wound healing by increasing no bioavailability."
3939,21854546L8,21854546,the potential of exogenous folic acid as an inexpensive and safe oral therapy stimulates ongoing investigations.
3940,26272708L0,26272708,"disintegrins are cysteine rich toxins containing the rgd motif exposed in a loop that binds integrins such as αiibβ3, α5β1 and αvβ3."
3941,26272708L1,26272708,"the flexibility of the rgd loop, controlled by the profile of the cysteine pairs and the residues flanking the rgd sequence, are key structural features for the functional activity of these molecules."
3942,26272708L2,26272708,"recently, our group reported a transcript in the venom gland of bothrops neuwiedi corresponding to a new p ii svmp precursor, bnmpiix, in which the rgd binding loop includes many substituted residues and unique cysteine residues at the c terminal."
3943,26272708L3,26272708,"in this paper, we obtained the recombinant disintegrin domain of bnmpiix, neuwiedin, which inhibited adp induced platelet aggregation, endothelial cell adhesion to fibrinogen and tube formation in matrigel with no particular selectivity to αiibβ3 or endothelial cell integrins."
3944,26272708L4,26272708,this value was also comparable to the inhibition observed with other recombinant disintegrins with conserved cysteine positions and residues in rgd loop.
3945,26272708L5,26272708,"in this regard, neuwiedin is an important component to understand the functional relevance of the diversity generated by accelerated evolution of venom toxins as well as to find out eventual new disintegrin dependent targets that may be approached with disintegrins."
3946,11914259L0,11914259,"oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in atherogenesis, suggesting that antioxidants could prevent coronary artery disease."
3947,11914259L1,11914259,"however, the efficacy of vitamin c in reducing atherosclerosis is debatable in humans and has not been tested rigorously in animals."
3948,11914259L2,11914259,gulo( / )apoe( / ) mice were used to test a hypothesis that chronic vitamin c deficiency enhances the initiation and development of atherosclerosis.
3949,11914259L3,11914259,"these mice are dependent on dietary vitamin c because of the lack of l gulonolactone gamma oxidase and are prone to develop atherosclerosis because of lacking apolipoprotein e. beginning at 6 weeks of age, the gulo( / )apoe( / ) mice were fed regular chow or western type diets containing high fat and supplemented with either 0.033 g or 3.3 g/l of vitamin c in their drinking water."
3950,11914259L4,11914259,this regimen produced mice with chronically low vitamin c (average 1.5 microg/ml in plasma) or high vitamin c (average 10 to 30 microg/ml in plasma).
3951,11914259L5,11914259,"morphometric analysis showed that within each sex, age, and diet group, the sizes of the atherosclerotic plaques were not different between low vitamin c mice and high vitamin c mice."
3952,11914259L6,11914259,"however, advanced plaques in the low vitamin c mice had significantly reduced amounts of sirius red staining collagen (36.4+/ 2.2% versus 54.8+/ 2.3%, p<0.0001), larger necrotic cores within the plaques, and reduced fibroproliferation and neovascularization in the aortic adventitia."
3953,11914259L7,11914259,chronic vitamin c deficiency does not influence the initiation or progression of atherosclerotic plaques but severely compromises collagen deposition and induces a type of plaque morphology that is potentially vulnerable to rupture.
3954,21473868L0,21473868,smooth muscle cells (smcs) change phenotypes under various pathophysiological conditions.
3955,21473868L1,21473868,"these changes are largely controlled by the serum response factor (srf), a transcription factor that binds to cc (a/t)6 gg (carg) boxes in sm contractile genes."

3957,21473868L3,21473868,the smc mirna transcriptome (smc mirnaome) and its regulation by srf have not been determined.
3958,21473868L4,21473868,we performed massively parallel sequencing to identify gastrointestinal (gi) smc mirna transcriptomes in mice and humans.
3959,21473868L5,21473868,"smc mirna transcriptomes were mapped to identify all carg boxes, which were confirmed by srf knockdown and microarrays."
3960,21473868L6,21473868,quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to identify smc phenotypic mirnas in differentiated and proliferating smcs.
3961,21473868L7,21473868,"bioinformatics and target validation analysis showed regulation of smc phenotype by srf dependent, smc phenotype mirnas."

3963,21473868L9,21473868,the sm mirnaome consisted of hundreds of unique mirnas that were highly conserved among both species.
3964,21473868L10,21473868,we mapped mirnas carg boxes and found that many had an srf dependent signature in the sm mirnaome.
3965,21473868L11,21473868,the sm mirnas carg boxes had several distinct features.
3966,21473868L12,21473868,we also identified approximately 100 smc phenotypic mirnas that were induced in differentiated or proliferative smc phenotypes.
3967,21473868L13,21473868,"we showed that srf dependent, smc phenotypic mirnas bind and regulate srf and its cofactors, myocadin (myocd) and member of ets oncogene family elk1."

3973,7535814L4,7535814,incubation of isolated thymocyte nuclei with ca2+ stimulates lamin degradation before the detection of oligonucleosomal dna fragments.
3974,7535814L5,7535814,"however, in contrast to lamin dissolution during mitosis and some other forms of apoptosis, glucocorticoid induced degradation of lamin b1 in thymocytes is not accompanied by dephosphorylation mediated activation of cdc2."
3975,7535814L6,7535814,our results demonstrate that lamin degradation is an early feature of apoptosis in thymocytes and suggest that chromatin condensation and breakdown of the nuclear envelope may occur as a result of disruption of nuclear lamina architecture.
3976,15546953L0,15546953,we have previously established a model inducing hematopoietic stem cell (hsc) production of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (epcs) to revascularize ischemic injury in adult mouse retina.
3977,15546953L1,15546953,the unique vascular environment of the retina results in new blood vessel formation primarily from hsc derived epcs.
3978,15546953L2,15546953,"using mice deficient ( / ) in inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos), we show that vessel phenotype resulting from hemangioblast activity can be altered by modulation of the no/nos pathway."
3979,15546953L3,15546953,inos /  or enos /  animals were engrafted with wild type (wt) hscs expressing green fluorescence protein (gfp+) and subjected to our adult retinal ischemia model.
3980,15546953L4,15546953,"wt hemangioblast activity in adult inos /  recipients resulted in the formation of highly branched blood vessels of donor origin, which were readily perfused indicating functionality."
3981,15546953L5,15546953,"in contrast, enos /  recipients produced relatively unbranched blood vessels with significant donor contribution that were difficult to perfuse, indicating poor functionality."

3983,15546953L7,15546953,"this neovascularization, via epcs derived from the transplanted hscs, reveals that the no pathway can modulate epc activity and plays a critical role in both blood vessel formation in response to injury and normal endothelial cell maintenance."
3984,9315680L0,9315680,the stunted protein (stuap) is a member of a family of transcription factors that regulate fungal development and cell cycle progression.
3985,9315680L1,9315680,regulated stua gene expression is required for correct cell pattern formation during asexual reproduction (conidiation) and for initiation of the sexual reproductive cycle in aspergillus nidulans.
3986,9315680L2,9315680,transcriptional initiation from two different promoters yields overlapping mrnas (stua alpha and stuabeta) that upon translation yield the same protein.
3987,9315680L3,9315680,"here we show that multiple regulatory mechanisms interact to control (i) developmental competence dependent expression of both transcripts and (ii) induction dependent expression of stua alpha, but not stuabeta, by the conidiation specific bristle (brlap) transcriptional activator."
3988,9315680L4,9315680,"quantitative levels of both mrnas are further modulated by (i) an activator(s) located at a far upstream upstream activation sequence, (ii) feedback regulation by stuap, and (iii) positive translational regulation that requires the peptide product of a micro open reading frame unique to the stua alpha mrna 5' untranslated region."
3989,9315680L5,9315680,gradients in stua alpha expression were most important for correct cell and tissue type development.
3990,9315680L6,9315680,threshold requirements were as follows: metula phialide differentiation < ascosporogenesis < cleistothecial shell hülle cell differentiation.
3991,9315680L7,9315680,altered stua expression affected conidiophore morphology and conidial yields quantitatively but did not alter the temporal development of cell types or conidiophore density.
3992,9315680L8,9315680,"by contrast, the sexual cycle showed both temporal delay and quantitative reduction in the number of cleistothecial initials but normal morphogenesis of tissue types."
3993,25240941L0,25240941,a wide range of recent studies have detected inflammation as one of the most influent factors in the appearance and spreading of neurodegenerative brain diseases.
3994,25240941L1,25240941,"we aimed to understand the influence of interleukin 6 (il 6), c reactive protein (crp) and homocysteine (hcy) on patients suffering from alzheimer׳s disease (ad) and on their descendants."

3996,25240941L3,25240941,"the results of the conducted research are in accordance with the present scientific knowledge, namely a statistically significant difference for examined parameters has been determined between women suffering from ad and their daughters and control group examinees."
3997,25240941L4,25240941,"no difference was found in serum concentrations of il 6, highly sensitive c reactive protein (hscrp) and hcy between the groups of the middle aged descendants of patients with ad and healthy controls without family history of ad."
3998,25240941L5,25240941,this finding supports the hypothesis that these markers may not play causal role in the development of ad.
3999,25240941L6,25240941,this is supported by the obtained positive correlation between il 6 and hscrp and il 6 and hcy in ad patients while there is no such correlation between female subjects with or without a family history of ad.
4000,8504424L0,8504424,previous studies in experimental animals and patients have suggested a circadian variation in host toxicity following administration of 5 fluorodeoxyuridine (fdurd) although the biochemical mechanisms are not fully understood.
4001,8504424L1,8504424,"thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21), the initial enzyme in the thymidine phosphorylation pathway, is the first enzyme in the anabolism of fdurd."
4002,8504424L2,8504424,"dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (dpd; ec 1.3.1.2), is the rate limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine catabolic pathway and has been shown to be the key enzyme in fdurd catabolism."
4003,8504424L3,8504424,the present study examined the relationship between the suggested circadian variation in fdurd toxicity and potential circadian variations in the activity of these enzymes.
4004,8504424L4,8504424,"initial studies in sprague dawley rats confirmed that the time of fdurd administration affected death rate and other drug related toxicities including loss of body weight, diarrhea, and bone marrow suppression, with the least toxicity and highest survival rate being observed in rats receiving fdurd at 12:00 noon and 4:00 p.m. and the greatest toxicity and lowest survival rate at 12:00 midnight and 4:00 a.m. statistical analysis revealed a circadian pattern in fdurd toxicity (cosinor analysis, p < 0.001)."
4005,8504424L5,8504424,"in subsequent studies with the same species, we simultaneously measured tk and dpd activities in several tissues at various times over 24 h. under standardized light conditions (lights on, 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.; lights off, 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.), with sampling at 4 h intervals (4:00 and 8:00 a.m.; 12:00 noon; 4:00 and 8:00 p.m., and 12:00 midnight), a circadian variation in tk activity was observed (p < 0.0001, cosinor analysis) in bone marrow, intestinal mucosa, liver, and spleen."
4006,8504424L6,8504424,"in the same group of animals, a circadian pattern of dpd activity in liver and bone marrow was also observed (cosinor analysis, p < 0.0001) that was inverse compared to the circadian variation in tk activity (pearson correlation analysis, p < 0.05)."
4007,8504424L7,8504424,"further statistical analysis indicated that the observed circadian variation in fdurd toxicity was correlated with the circadian variation of tk activity and inversely correlated with dpd activity (pearson correlation analysis, p < 0.05)."
4008,8504424L8,8504424,"based on the above data, we conclude that the circadian pattern of tk and dpd activity may explain the observed circadian variation in toxicity as the time of fdurd administration is varied."
4009,8504424L9,8504424,these results may be useful in the design of improved chemotherapeutic regimens using time modified administration of fdurd.
4010,9211711L0,9211711,an enzyme specifically induced during 4 methylmuconolactone metabolism by alcaligenes eutrophus jmp 134 and that exhibited muconolactone isomerizing activity was purified to homogeneity.
4011,9211711L1,9211711,"the enzyme, involved in the isomerization of 3 methylmuconolactone had a high degree of sequence similarity with muconolactone isomerase of alcaligenes eutrophus jmp 134 and other previously described muconolactone isomerases of the 3 oxoadipate pathway."
4012,9211711L2,9211711,"kinetic analysis showed that the enzyme has a substrate spectrum and a reaction mechanism similar to those of the muconolactone isomerase, but that it has distinct kinetic properties."

4014,18408733L1,18408733,"sumoylation of its pml moiety was previously implicated, but the nature of the degradation pathway involved and the role of pml raralpha catabolism in the response to therapy have both remained elusive."
4015,18408733L2,18408733,"here, we demonstrate that arsenic induced pml sumoylation triggers its lys 48 linked polyubiquitination and proteasome dependent degradation."
4016,18408733L3,18408733,"when exposed to arsenic, sumoylated pml recruits rnf4, the human orthologue of the yeast sumo dependent e3 ubiquitin ligase, as well as ubiquitin and proteasomes onto pml nuclear bodies."
4017,18408733L4,18408733,"arsenic induced differentiation is impaired in cells transformed by a non degradable pml raralpha sumoylation mutant or in apl cells transduced with a dominant negative rnf4, directly implicating pml raralpha catabolism in the therapeutic response."
4018,18408733L5,18408733,we thus identify pml as the first protein degraded by sumo dependent polyubiquitination.
4019,18408733L6,18408733,"as pml sumoylation recruits not only rnf4, ubiquitin and proteasomes, but also many sumoylated proteins onto pml nuclear bodies, these domains could physically integrate the sumoylation, ubiquitination and degradation pathways."
4020,11953455L0,11953455,"we report that the forkhead family of transcription factors, fkhrl1, fkhr and afx are novel components of neurotrophin receptor signaling."
4021,11953455L1,11953455,ngf rapidly induced the phosphorylation of fkhrl1 in pc12 cells.
4022,11953455L2,11953455,this effect is mediated by high affinity trka receptor as nerve growth factor (ngf) induced the phosphorylation of fkhrl1 only in trka expressing cells and not p75 expressing cells.
4023,11953455L3,11953455,"additional experiments with various kinase inhibitors, the transient expression of constitutively active and dominant negative akt, and in vitro kinase assay revealed that phosphatidylinositol 3 (ptdins3)/akt kinase mediated the actions of ngf."
4024,11953455L4,11953455,"similar data were obtained for brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), neurotrophin 3 (nt 3) and neurotrophin 4 (nt 4) in primary cortical cultured neurons."
4025,11953455L5,11953455,these findings demonstrate for the first time that the phosphorylation of the forkhead family of transcription factors can be modulated by neurotrophins via trk receptors and ptdins3k/akt kinase (but not map or s6p70 kinases) in neuronal and non neuronal cells.
4026,11953455L6,11953455,"moreover, survival assays with the ptdins3 kinase inhibitor ly294002, active and dominant negative forms of akt indicate that the phosphorylation of fkhrl1 plays a role in neurotrophins mediated cell survival."
4027,6237715L0,6237715,certain aspects of the metabolism of oxygen derivatives were investigated in the cerebral cortex from down's syndrome (trisomy 21) fetuses.
4028,6237715L1,6237715,"in comparison with controls of similar gestational age, the specific activity of the cytosolic cu/zn dependent superoxide dismutase (sod i) was significantly elevated by 60 +/  5%."
4029,6237715L2,6237715,"this is consistent with a gene dosage effect, as the gene coding for sod i is on chromosome 21. in order to determine whether the increase in sod i activity is associated with an adaptive rise in glutathione peroxidase (gshpx), as has been observed in other tissues, the activity of this enzyme was also estimated but was found not to be altered in the down's syndrome brain."
4030,6237715L3,6237715,"in addition, in vitro lipoperoxidation, estimated by the formation of malondialdehyde (mda) on incubation of homogenates fortified with ascorbate and fe2+, was significantly elevated (36 +/  4%) in cerebral cortex of the down's syndrome fetuses."
4031,6237715L4,6237715,"the concentration of total combined polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) was not significantly altered in the tissue, although there is evidence for differences in the composition of certain phospholipids."
4032,6237715L5,6237715,"it is proposed that, on account of the evidence for a potential perturbation of oxygen free radical metabolism (notably an increased sod i activity not compensated by a rise in gshpx) and for enhanced in vitro peroxidizability of pufa, there may be increased lipoperoxidative damage in the down's syndrome brain prenatally."
4033,26787455L0,26787455,"inflammation of the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) causes pain and altered motility, at least in part through the damage of the myenteric neurons (mns)."
4034,26787455L1,26787455,"thus, it is important to evaluate new drugs for uc treatment that could also protect myenteric neurons efficiently."
4035,26787455L2,26787455,"as a well known neural protective and anti inflammatory agent, melatonin could protect neurons from damage through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 and antioxidant responsive element (nrf2 are) signaling pathway."
4036,26787455L3,26787455,"therefore, we investigated the potential protective effect of melatonin against mn damage during colitis induced by 2,4 dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (dnbs) in rats."
4037,26787455L4,26787455,colitis was induced by intracolonic (i.c.)
4038,26787455L5,26787455,instillation of dnbs and treated with melatonin at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg for 4 days.
4039,26787455L6,26787455,the damage of mn in the left colon was immunohistochemically evaluated in different groups.
4040,26787455L7,26787455,ulcerations and inflammation in the colon were semiquantitatively observed.
4041,26787455L8,26787455,"myeloperoxidase (mpo), superoxide dismutase (sod), and malondialdehyde (mda) levels were detected to evaluate the inflammatory and oxidative stress status."
4042,26787455L9,26787455,"the protein and mrna expressions of nrf2 and heme oxygenase 1 (ho 1) in the colon were detected by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr), respectively."
4043,26787455L10,26787455,melatonin partially prevented the loss of mn and alleviated the inflammation and oxidative stress induced by dnbs.
4044,26787455L11,26787455,"in addition, melatonin markedly increased the nrf2 and ho 1 level in the colitis."
4045,26787455L12,26787455,"these results indicate that melatonin protects mn from damage by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, effects that are partly mediated by the nrf2 are pathway."
4046,8875080L0,8875080,"although functional studies indicate that tight junctions (tj) are present in xenopus laevis embryos from the 2 cell stage onward, morphological studies have failed to identify typical tj structures before the 32 cell stage."
4047,8875080L1,8875080,nothing is known about the expression and localization of tj proteins in early xenopus development.
4048,8875080L2,8875080,here we have investigated the formation and composition of tj in developing xenopus embryos by whole mount immunoperoxidase staining of eggs/embryos and immunoblotting of extracts with an antiserum against the tj protein cingulin.
4049,8875080L3,8875080,immunoblot analysis of eggs and embryo extracts showed that the antiserum labeled a major polypeptide of apparent m(r) 160 kd.
4050,8875080L4,8875080,maternal cingulin was distributed diffusely in the cytocortical region of eggs and early embryos.
4051,8875080L5,8875080,intense cingulin labeling became localized in the junctional region starting from the first cell division (2 cell stage).
4052,8875080L6,8875080,"during cytokinesis, cingulin labeling was accumulated into new junctions in a precise spatial/temporal relationship with the deepening of the cleavage furrow."
4053,8875080L7,8875080,"in semithin sections of stained embryos, labeling was detected in the most apical portion of the region of cell cell contact."
4054,8875080L8,8875080,"in embryos incubated in low calcium medium for 30 min, newly divided blastomeres failed to completely adhere to each other."
4055,8875080L9,8875080,"however, cingulin labeling was accumulated along a linear structure that was at the border between distinct membrane domains (apical and lateral)."
4056,8875080L10,8875080,these observations provide the first description of assembly of a tj protein at the earliest stages of xenopus development and suggest that tj occur from the 2 cell stage onward and are assembled with maternal stores of protein.
4057,8875080L11,8875080,the formation of cingulin containing structures even when lateral cell cell adhesion is greatly reduced suggests that the apical cytocortex may have a determinative influence on tj assembly and establishment of cell polarity.
4058,20586719L0,20586719,enzymes belonging to the pla(2) superfamily catalyze the hydrolysis of unsaturated fatty acids from the sn 2 position of glycerol moiety of neural membrane phospholipids.
4059,20586719L1,20586719,"the pla(2) superfamily is classified into cytosolic pla(2) (cpla(2)), calcium independent pla(2) (ipla(2)), plasmalogen selective pla(2) (plsetn pla(2)) and secretory pla(2) (spla(2))."
4060,20586719L2,20586719,pla(2) paralogs/splice variants/isozymes are part of a complex signal transduction network that maintains cross talk among excitatory amino acid and dopamine receptors through the generation of second messengers.
4061,20586719L3,20586719,"individual paralogs, splice variants and multiple forms of pla(2) may have unique enzymatic properties, tissue and subcellular localizations and role in various physiological and pathological situations, hence tight regulation of all pla(2) isoforms is essential for normal brain function."
4062,20586719L4,20586719,quantitative rt pcr analyses show significantly higher relative level of expression of ipla(2) than cpla(2) in all regions of the rat brain.
4063,20586719L5,20586719,"upregulation of the cpla(2) family is involved in degradation of neural membrane phospholipids and generation of arachidonic acid derived lipid metabolites that have been implicated in nociception, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and neurodegeneration."
4064,20586719L6,20586719,"in contrast, studies using a selective ipla(2) inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, or antisense oligonucleotide indicate that ipla(2) is an important ""housekeeping"" enzyme under basal conditions, whose activity is required for the prevention of vacuous chewing movements, a rodent model for tardive dyskinesia, and deficits in the prepulse inhibition of the auditory startle reflex, a common finding in schizophrenia."
4065,20586719L7,20586719,"these studies support the view that pla(2) activity may not only play a crucial role in neurodegeneration but depending on the isoform, could also be essential in prevention of neuropsychiatric diseases."
4066,20586719L8,20586719,the findings could open new doors for understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.
4067,16138898L0,16138898,"poxviruses, a family of large dna viruses, are unique among dna viruses, because they carry out dna replication in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus."
4068,16138898L1,16138898,"this process does not occur randomly, but instead, these viruses create cytoplasmic 'mini nuclei', distinct sites that are surrounded by membranes derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (er) that support viral replication."
4069,16138898L2,16138898,"this review summarizes how distinct steps preceding cytoplasmic dna replication, as well as replication itself, operate in the host cell."
4070,16138898L3,16138898,the collective data point to an important role for both the rough er and the microtubules and indicate that these cellular structures help to co ordinate the virus life cycle to ensure that individual steps occur at the right time and place.
4071,16138898L4,16138898,"in a broader sense, they emphasize how viruses have evolved sophisticated ways to use host cells to optimize their life cycles to ensure efficient production of infectious progeny."
4072,7981151L0,7981151,protein tyrosine kinase p59fyn is associated with the tcr cd3 complex and is suggested to play a role in t cell activation.
4073,7981151L1,7981151,"to determine the molecular mechanism of p59fyn mediated signal transduction in t cell activation, we established murine t cell hybridoma lines that expressed an elevated amount of wild type or mutant fyns."
4074,7981151L2,7981151,"clones that expressed high levels of normal p59fyn and active p59fyn, encoded by wild type and f 14 mutant fyn respectively, showed enhanced il 2 production upon stimulation by anti cd3 antibodies or natural antigen."
4075,7981151L3,7981151,"on the other hand, clones that expressed kinase negative p59fyn and p59fyn with an sh2 (src homology 2) deletion encoded by t 1 mutant fyn showed little induction of il 2 production upon stimulation."
4076,7981151L4,7981151,these data suggest that p59fyn is important in t cell signaling and that the sh2 sequence plays a critical role in the reaction.
4077,7981151L5,7981151,induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins upon antigenic stimulation was augmented similarly in the cells that respectively expressed wild type and f 14 mutant fyns at elevated levels.
4078,7981151L6,7981151,"the proteins that became highly tyrosine phosphorylated included phospholipase c (plc gamma 1), p95vav, zap 70, the map kinase, cd3 zeta and unidentified proteins of 120, 100 and 80 kda."
4079,7981151L7,7981151,"tyrosine phosphorylation of the 120, 95 and 68 kda proteins associated with plc gamma 1 was also observed in these cells upon stimulation."
4080,7981151L8,7981151,"in contrast, only the 100 kda protein and the map kinase were increasingly tyrosine phosphorylated in the antigen stimulated cells expressing t 1 fyn."
4081,7981151L9,7981151,"these data suggest that plc gamma 1, plc gamma 1 associated molecules, p95vav, the 80 kda protein, zap 70 and the cd3 zeta chain may be substrates of p59fyn or of other tyrosine kinases regulated by p59fyn and be important in t cell signaling."
4082,1903197L0,1903197,"the presence of gsp mutations at codons 201 and 227 in the gene coding for the alpha subunit of the gtp binding gs protein which stimulates adenylyl cyclase (ac) has been investigated in 31 samples of differentiated thyroid tumours, which had been previously characterized with respect to their adenylyl cyclase activity (aca) before and after stimulation by thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh)."
4083,1903197L1,1903197,"polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of dna extracted from these tumours, followed by high stringency oligonucleotide probing, enabled the detection of mutations in three samples originating from tumours with high constitutive aca, which was not significantly further stimulated by tsh."
4084,1903197L2,1903197,"two mutations were at codon 227 and replaced gln227 by his or lys, and one was at codon 201, with the substitution of arg201 by ser."
4085,1903197L3,1903197,"because thyrocytes belong to the subset of differentiated cells which are programmed to proliferate in response to elevated camp levels, the gsp mutations observed in some differentiated thyroid carcinomas probably contributed to their tumorigenic phenotype."
4086,12870653L0,12870653,"the effect of oxidative stress on the ca2+ atpase activity, lipid peroxidation and protein modification of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) membranes was investigated."
4087,12870653L1,12870653,isolated sr vesicles were exposed to feso4/edta (0.2 micromol fe2+ per mg of protein) at 37 degrees c for 1 h in the presence or absence of antioxidants.
4088,12870653L2,12870653,feso4/edta decreased the maximum velocity of ca2+ atpase reaction without a change of affinity for ca2+ or hill coefficient.
4089,12870653L3,12870653,"treatment with radical generating system led also to conjugated diene formation, loss of sulfhydryl groups, changes in tryptophan and bityrosine fluorescences and to production of lysine conjugates with lipid peroxidation end products."
4090,12870653L4,12870653,"lipid antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (bht) and stobadine partially prevented inhibition of ca2+ atpase and decrease in tryptophan fluorescence, while the loss of  sh groups and formation of bityrosines or lysine conjugates were completely prevented."
4091,12870653L5,12870653,"glutathione also partially protected ca2+ atpase activity and decreased formation of bityrosine, but it was not able to prevent oxidative modification of tryptophan and lysine."
4092,12870653L6,12870653,"these findings suggest that combination of amino acid modifications, rather than oxidation of amino acids of one kind, is responsible for inhibition of sr ca2+ atpase activity."
4093,8344412L0,8344412,several molecular elements of programmed cell death and apoptosis have recently been revealed.
4094,8344412L1,8344412,the function of gene products which deliver the lethal 'hit' is still not known.
4095,8344412L2,8344412,well characterized and newly discovered cell surface structures (e.g.
4096,8344412L3,8344412,"antigen receptors, fas/apo 1), as well as transcriptional factors (steroid receptor, c myc, p53, retinoblastoma protein and others), have been implicated in the initiation of the death pathway."
4097,8344412L4,8344412,negative regulators of the process (ced 9 gene product in programmed death of cells in caenorhabditis elegans and bcl 2 protein in apoptosis) have been described.
4098,8344412L5,8344412,"biochemical mechanisms responsible for the silent nature of natural deaths of cells include their rapid engulfment (mainly through integrin receptors), transglutaminase catalyzed cross linking of cellular proteins, and fragmentation of dna."
4099,8344412L6,8344412,several lines of evidence suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms may operate in various forms of natural cell death.
4100,24014024L0,24014024,the no reductase from paracoccus denitrificans reduces no to n2o (2no + 2h(+) + 2e( ) → n2o + h2o) with electrons donated by periplasmic cytochrome c (cytochrome c dependent no reductase; cnor).
4101,24014024L1,24014024,"cnors are members of the heme copper oxidase superfamily of integral membrane proteins, comprising the o2 reducing, proton pumping respiratory enzymes."
4102,24014024L2,24014024,"in contrast, although no reduction is as exergonic as o2 reduction, there are no protons pumped in cnor, and in addition, protons needed for no reduction are derived from the periplasmic solution (no contribution to the electrochemical gradient is made)."
4103,24014024L3,24014024,cnor thus only needs to transport protons from the periplasm into the active site without the requirement to control the timing of opening and closing (gating) of proton pathways as is needed in a proton pump.
4104,24014024L4,24014024,"based on the crystal structure of a closely related cnor and molecular dynamics simulations, several proton transfer pathways were suggested, and in principle, these could all be functional."
4105,24014024L5,24014024,"in this work, we show that residues in one of the suggested pathways (denoted pathway 1) are sensitive to site directed mutation, whereas residues in the other proposed pathways (pathways 2 and 3) could be exchanged without severe effects on turnover activity with either no or o2."
4106,24014024L6,24014024,we further show that electron transfer during single turnover reduction of o2 is limited by proton transfer and can thus be used to study alterations in proton transfer rates.
4107,24014024L7,24014024,the exchange of residues along pathway 1 showed specific slowing of this proton coupled electron transfer as well as changes in its ph dependence.
4108,24014024L8,24014024,our results indicate that only pathway 1 is used to transfer protons in cnor.
4109,23287393L0,23287393,"the importance of laminin containing basement membranes (bm) for adult muscle function is well established, in particular due to the severe phenotype of congenital muscular dystrophies in patients with mutations disrupting the bm muscle cell interaction."
4110,23287393L1,23287393,developing muscles in the embryo are also dependent on an intact bm.
4111,23287393L2,23287393,"however, the processes controlled by bm muscle cell interactions in the embryo are only beginning to be elucidated."
4112,23287393L3,23287393,"in this review, we focus on the myotomal bm to illustrate the critical role of laminin 111 in bm assembly and function at the surface of embryonic muscle cells."
4113,23287393L4,23287393,the myotomal bm provides also an interesting paradigm to study the complex interplay between laminins containing bm and growth factor mediated signaling and activity.
4114,19345147L0,19345147,"mutations in thap1 were recently identified as the cause of dyt6 primary dystonia; a founder mutation was detected in amish mennonite families, and a different mutation was identified in another family of european descent."
4115,19345147L1,19345147,"to assess more broadly the role of this gene, we screened for mutations in families that included one family member who had early onset, non focal primary dystonia."
4116,19345147L2,19345147,we identified 36 non dyt1 multiplex families in which at least one person had non focal involvement at an age of onset that was younger than 22 years.
4117,19345147L3,19345147,"all three coding exons of thap1 were sequenced, and the clinical features of individuals with mutations were compared with those of individuals who were negative for mutations in thap1."
4118,19345147L4,19345147,genotype phenotype differences were also assessed.
4119,19345147L5,19345147,"of 36 families, nine (25%) had members with mutations in thap1, and most were of german, irish, or italian ancestry."
4120,19345147L6,19345147,"one family had the amish mennonite founder mutation, whereas the other eight families each had novel, potentially truncating or missense mutations."
4121,19345147L7,19345147,"the clinical features of the families with mutations conformed to the previously described dyt6 phenotype; however, age at onset was extended from 38 years to 49 years."
4122,19345147L8,19345147,"compared with non carriers, mutation carriers were younger at onset and their dystonia was more likely to begin in brachial, rather than cervical, muscles, become generalised, and include speech involvement."
4123,19345147L9,19345147,genotype phenotype differences were not found.
4124,19345147L10,19345147,mutations in thap1 underlie a substantial proportion of early onset primary dystonia in non dyt1 families.
4125,19345147L11,19345147,"the clinical features that are characteristic of affected individuals who have mutations in thap1 include limb and cranial muscle involvement, and speech is often affected."

4132,14972027L5,14972027,"in addition, our results reveal that arg244 and ser246 are involved in generating the reaction product during enzyme catalysis."
4133,14972027L6,14972027,the structure agrees well with the biochemical and site directed mutagenesis results.
4134,14972027L7,14972027,"the three dimensional structure together with the steady state kinetics of both the wild type and mutant md aco1 proteins reveal how the substrate specificity of md aco1 is involved in the catalytic mechanism, providing insights into understanding the fruit ripening process at atomic resolution."

4136,10326827L1,10326827,we studied the effects of insulin on intact aortic rings of wistar rats preincubated 1 2 h with 240 pm (i1) and 960 pm (i2) insulin with and without no synthesis inhibition by n(omega) nitro l arginine methyl ester (l name).
4137,10326827L2,10326827,"resting force was tripled by 0.1 mm l name in control (c) and i1 groups, but not in i2 groups."

4147,1739972L0,1739972,influenza virus hemagglutinin (ha) mediates viral entry into cells by a low ph induced membrane fusion event in endosomes.
4148,1739972L1,1739972,a number of structural changes occur throughout the length of ha at the ph of fusion.
4149,1739972L2,1739972,"to probe their significance and their necessity for fusion activity, we have prepared a site directed mutant ha containing novel intersubunit disulfide bonds designed to cross link covalently the membrane distal domains of the trimer."
4150,1739972L3,1739972,these mutations inhibited the low ph induced conformational changes and prevented ha mediated membrane fusion; conditions that reduced the novel disulfide bonds restored membrane fusion activity.
4151,1739972L4,1739972,we conclude that structural rearrangements in the membrane distal region of the ha are required for membrane fusion activity.

4154,14871981L2,14871981,one strategy for inhibiting carcinogenesis is to prevent pge2 production in premalignant and malignant tissues.
4155,14871981L3,14871981,"it is important, therefore, to determine whether enzymes involved in pge2 biosynthesis are deregulated in neoplasia."
4156,14871981L4,14871981,the main purpose of this study was to determine whether amounts of cox 2 or mpges 1 were increased in intraepithelial neoplasia or squamous cell carcinoma (scc) of the penis.
4157,14871981L5,14871981,"because human papillomavirus (hpv) has been linked to the development of penile scc, a secondary objective was to determine whether cox 2 was overexpressed in scc arising in an hpv16 transgenic mouse."
4158,14871981L6,14871981,immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to evaluate the expression of cox 2 and mpges 1 in benign and malignant lesions including metastases to lymph nodes.
4159,14871981L7,14871981,amounts of intratumoral pge2 were quantified by enzyme immunoassay.
4160,14871981L8,14871981,reverse transcription pcr was used to determine the expression of each of the four known receptors (ep(1 4)) for pge2.

4165,14871981L13,14871981,increased amounts of cox 2 and mpges 1 were detected in penile intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma.
4166,14871981L14,14871981,these findings provide the basis for evaluating whether inhibiting cox 2 will be useful in the prevention or treatment of penile scc.

4169,3297673L2,3297673,"three kinds of dna duplexes, the lambda or3 17 mer, phi80 or2 19 mer and crp binding site 22 mer, were prepared, and all of their imino proton resonances of the complexes with lambda cro were assigned to individual base pairs."
4170,3297673L3,3297673,"by monitoring the assigned signals of the dna fragments and lambda cro, it was found that in the complex of lambda cro with lambda or3, two subunits of the cro dimer bind to the right and left halves of the or3, respectively, and the bidentate binding induces a structural distortion in the middle of the 17 mer."
4171,3297673L4,3297673,lambda cro itself also undergoes a conformational change including loosening of the dimeric form.
4172,3297673L5,3297673,"in the complex of lambda cro with phi 80 or2, which has a 6 bp sequence common to that of lambda or3, one subunit of the cro dimer seems to bind specifically to the common part."
4173,3297673L6,3297673,"however, there is only a slight conformational change in the cro dimer."
4174,3297673L7,3297673,"in the mixture of the crp binding site 22 mer and lambda cro, soft contact without any conformational change was observed between them."
4175,26832L0,26832,"although the primary genetic defect in all individuals with gaucher's disease is a deficiency in glucocerebrosidase activity, the finding of marked elevations in splenic and serum acid phosphatase activity is almost as consistent a finding."
4176,26832L1,26832,gaucher spleen and serum contain at least two forms of acid phosphatase that can be readily separated by chromatography on columns containing the cation exchange resin sulphopropyl sephadex.
4177,26832L2,26832,"the major species of acid phosphatase (designated sp i) contained in triton x 100 (1% v/v) extracts of gaucher spleen accounts for 65%  95% of the total activity and has the following properties: (1) it does not bind to the cation exchange column; (2) it exhibitis a ph optimum of 4.5  5.0; (3) it is inhibited by sodium fluoride (15 mm), l(+) tartaric acid (20 mm), and beta mercaptoethanol (2.1 m), and (4) it is resistant to inhibition by sodium dithionite (10 mm)."
4178,26832L3,26832,the minor acid phosphatase activity (designated sp ii) present in extracts of gaucher spleen has properties similar to those of the major species of acid phosphatase activity contained in serum from patients with gaucher's disease: (1) it binds firmly to cation exchange columns (eluted by 0.5 m sodium chloride); (2) it exhibits a ph optimum of 5.0  6.0; (3) it is inhibited by sodium fluoride and sodium dithionite; and (4) it is resistant to inhibition by beta mercaptoethanol (2.1 m) and l(+) tartaric acid (20 mm).
4179,26832L4,26832,"in addition, a second form of acid phosphatase that is tartrate resistant was found to be elevated in gaucher serum."
4180,26832L5,26832,"this form of serum acid phosphatase did not bind to sulphopropyl sephadex, was found to be significantly resistant to beta mercaptoethanol (2.1 m), and was only partially inhibited by sodium dithionite (10 mm)."
4181,26832L6,26832,the findings reported here indicate that at least three distinct forms of acid phosphatase activity are elevated in gaucher's disease.
4182,26832L7,26832,"furthermore, the minor acid phosphatase activity contained in spleen homogenates has properties very similar to those of the major acid phosphatase activity observed to be present in serum of patients with gaucher's disease."
4183,26832L8,26832,these data indicate that simple spleen spillage cannot account for the increased levels of serum acid phosphatase in patients with gaucher's disease.
4184,9030683L0,9030683,regulation of gene expression via allosteric control of transcription is one of the fundamental concepts of molecular biology.
4185,9030683L1,9030683,studies in prokaryotes have illustrated that binding of small molecules or ligands to sequence specific transcription factors can produce conformational changes at a distance from the binding site.
4186,9030683L2,9030683,these ligand induced changes can dramatically alter the dna binding and/or trans activation abilities of the target transcription factors.
4187,9030683L3,9030683,"in this work, analysis of trans activation by members of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily identifies a unique form of allosteric control, the phantom ligand effect."
4188,9030683L4,9030683,binding of a novel ligand (lg100754) to one subunit (rxr) of a heterodimeric transcription factor results in a linked conformational change in the second noncovalently bound subunit of the heterodimer (rar).
4189,9030683L5,9030683,this conformational change results in both the dissociation of corepressors and association of coactivators in a fashion mediated by the activation function of the non liganded subunit.
4190,9030683L6,9030683,"without occupying the rar hormone binding pocket, binding of lg100754 to rxr mimics exactly the effects observed when hormone is bound to rar."
4191,9030683L7,9030683,"thus, lg100754 behaves as a phantom ligand."
4192,11802721L0,11802721,we have investigated the mechanism of functional cooperativity between specificity protein 1 (sp1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (hnf 4) on the human apolipoprotein ciii (apociii) promoter.
4193,11802721L1,11802721,cotransfections in drosophila sl2 cells that lack endogenous sp1 or sp1 related activities showed that hnf 4 and sp1 synergistically transactivate the  890/+24 apociii promoter up to 150 fold.
4194,11802721L2,11802721,synergistic transactivation required the hnf 4 binding site of the apociii enhancer.
4195,11802721L3,11802721,"deletion of part of the ser/thr rich and gln rich domain or the c terminal domain of sp1 decreased, and deletion of residues 501 610 of sp1 increased, the functional cooperativity between sp1 and hnf 4. physical interactions between the two factors were demonstrated by glutathione s transferase pull down and co immunoprecipitation assays."
4196,11802721L4,11802721,the amino terminal domain of both factors and the carboxy terminal domain of sp1 contribute to these interactions.
4197,11802721L5,11802721,"antagonism between hnf 4 and sp1 was demonstrated on homopolymeric promoters containing multiple binding sites for either factor, suggesting that the synergism between the two factors occurs only when both factors are bound simultaneously to the dna."
4198,11802721L6,11802721,the observed physical interactions between sp1 and hnf 4 in the context of the apociii promoter may explain in part their in vitro and in vivo synergism in the transcriptional activation of the apolipoprotein a i/apociii/apolipoprotein a iv gene cluster.
4199,29355735L0,29355735,targeting cancer cells with photosensitizer (ps) excited by appropriate laser irradiation to release singlet oxygen as a photodynamic therapy (pdt) remains a challenge.
4200,29355735L1,29355735,this research aimed to assess the cytogenetic potential of 5 aminolevulinic acid (5 ala) activated with laser irradiation (5 ala/pdt) to damage the intact dna of adenocarcinoma breast cancer cell line (mcf 7) and hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (hepg2).
4201,29355735L2,29355735,"cancer cells were treated with 0.5 and 1 mm 5 ala for 4 h, the precursor of the photochemical protoporphyrin ix (ppix), and then exposed to laser irradiation at 633 nm and 0.25 w for 4 min before incubation for 24 h. cytotoxicity of cancer cells was assessed using trypan blue exclusion assay."
4202,29355735L3,29355735,genotoxicity was recorded by micronucleus test and comet assay.
4203,29355735L4,29355735,"both 5 ala and laser irradiation, separately, were nontoxic on cancer cell lines, however, 5 ala/pdt enhanced cell death in a concentration dependent manner."
4204,29355735L5,29355735,"also, 5 ala/pdt generated high percentages of micronuclei in mcf 7 and hepg2 cell lines as recorded in binucleated cells."
4205,29355735L6,29355735,"similarly, the mean percentages of dna damage and tail moment ratio were intensified extremely in cancer cell lines treated with 5 ala/pdt rather than non treated cells or cells treated by 5 ala or laser irradiation separately."
4206,29355735L7,29355735,"in conclusion, the singlet oxygen of 5 ala targets dna of cancer cells when activated by laser irradiation."
4207,29355735L8,29355735,"therefore, photodynamic therapy is an applicable process to damage dna effectively during m phase and prohibit cancer cells proliferation."
4208,27907040L0,27907040,the metabolic syndrome is associated with prolonged stress and hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and afflicted subjects are prone to develop cardiovascular disease.
4209,27907040L1,27907040,"under normal conditions, the cardiomyocyte response to acute β adrenergic stimulation partly depends on increased production of reactive oxygen species (ros)."
4210,27907040L2,27907040,"here we investigated the interplay between beta adrenergic signaling, ros and cardiac contractility using freshly isolated cardiomyocytes and whole hearts from two mouse models with the metabolic syndrome (high fat diet and ob/ob mice)."
4211,27907040L3,27907040,we hypothesized that cardiomyocytes of mice with the metabolic syndrome would experience excessive ros levels that trigger cellular dysfunctions.
4212,27907040L4,27907040,"fluorescent dyes and confocal microscopy were used to assess mitochondrial ros production, cellular ca2+ handling and contractile function in freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes."
4213,27907040L5,27907040,"immunofluorescence, western blot and enzyme assay were used to study protein biochemistry."
4214,27907040L6,27907040,"unexpectedly, our results point towards decreased cardiac ros signaling in a stable, chronic phase of the metabolic syndrome because: β adrenergic induced increases in the amplitude of intracellular ca2+ signals were insensitive to antioxidant treatment; mitochondrial ros production showed decreased basal rate and smaller response to β adrenergic stimulation."
4215,27907040L7,27907040,"moreover, control hearts and hearts with the metabolic syndrome showed similar basal levels of ros mediated protein modification, but only control hearts showed increases after β adrenergic stimulation."
4216,27907040L8,27907040,"in conclusion, in contrast to the situation in control hearts, the cardiomyocyte response to acute β adrenergic stimulation does not involve increased mitochondrial ros production in a stable, chronic phase of the metabolic syndrome."
4217,27907040L9,27907040,this can be seen as a beneficial adaptation to prevent excessive ros levels.
4218,7538009L0,7538009,it is currently thought that nuclear pore complexes (npcs) primarily govern nucleocytoplasmic interactions via selective recognition and active transport of macromolecules.
4219,7538009L1,7538009,"however, in various nuclear preparations, patch clamp and fluorescence, luminiscence and ion microscopy support classical microelectrode measurements indicating that monoatomic ion flow across the nuclear envelope (ne) is strictly regulated."
4220,7538009L2,7538009,gating of large conductance nuclear envelope ion channels (nics) somewhat resembles that of gap junctional channels.
4221,7538009L3,7538009,"in other respects, nics are distinct in that they require cytosolic factors, are blocked by wheat germ agglutinin and are blocked and/or modified by antibodies to epitopes of npc glycoproteins."
4222,7538009L4,7538009,"therefore, nic activity, recorded as electrical current/conductance is likely to be intrinsic to npcs."
4223,7538009L5,7538009,"this observation suggests a potential use for the patch clamp technique in establishing the mechanisms underlying nuclear pore gating in response to cytosolic and nucleosolic factors such as transcription and growth factors, oncogene and proto oncogene products and receptors for retinoids, steroids and thyroid hormone."
4224,7538009L6,7538009,nic activity may also be useful in evaluating the mechanisms of nuclear import of foreign nucleic acid material such as that contained in virons and viroids.
4225,7538009L7,7538009,"finally, in consideration to the electrophysiological data accumulated so far, the study of nuclear pore ion channel activity may help our understanding of other important issues such as cell suicide, programmed cell death or apoptosis."
4226,26547700L0,26547700,"several approaches have been tried for the treatment of tinnitus, from cognitive behavioral therapies and sound enrichment to medication."
4227,26547700L1,26547700,"in this context, antioxidants, widely used in numerous areas of medicine, appear to represent a promising approach for the control of this symptom, which often is poorly controlled."
4228,26547700L2,26547700,to evaluate the effects of antioxidant therapy for tinnitus in a group of elderly patients.
4229,26547700L3,26547700,"prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial."
4230,26547700L4,26547700,"the sample consisted of 58 subjects aged 60 years or older, with a complaint of tinnitus associated with sensorineural hearing loss."
4231,26547700L5,26547700,these individuals completed the tinnitus handicap inventory (thi) questionnaire before and after six months of therapy.
4232,26547700L6,26547700,"the treatment regimens were: ginkgo biloba dry extract (120mg/day), α lipoic acid (60mg/day)+vitamin c (600mg/day), papaverine hydrochloride (100mg/day)+vitamin e (400mg/day), and placebo."
4233,26547700L7,26547700,there was no statistically significant difference between thi by degree (p=0.441) and by score (p=0.848) before and after treatment.
4234,26547700L8,26547700,there was no benefit from the use of antioxidant agents for tinnitus in this sample.
4235,24459866L0,24459866,"the analysis of the literature and our own results indicates that a nitric oxide carries out a role the allosteric effector of hemoglobin, changing its affinity to oxygen and defining a condition of oxygen transport blood function."
4236,24459866L1,24459866,"it is important point for modification of functional properties of hemoglobin and its participation in the flow of oxygen in tissues, which plays an important role in development of disadaption reactions at stress and decreased bioactivity of the nitric oxide at the endothelial dysfunction."
4237,24459866L2,24459866,these findings give possiblity to creat the new ways to correct hypoxical conditions through influence on oxygen binding properties of the blood and activity of l arginin no system.
4238,15655931L0,15655931,"pemetrexed (alimta) is a novel antimetabolite that inhibits the folate dependent enzymes thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase."
4239,15655931L1,15655931,"pemetrexed has demonstrated activity in clinical trials in a variety of tumor types, including lung, breast, colon, mesothelioma, pancreatic, gastric, bladder, head and neck, and cervix."
4240,15655931L2,15655931,pemetrexed is rapidly metabolized into active polyglutamate forms that are potent inhibitors of several tetrahydrofolate cofactor requiring enzymes critical to the synthesis of purines and thymidine.
4241,15655931L3,15655931,"functionally, pemetrexed acts as a prodrug for its polyglutamate forms."
4242,15655931L4,15655931,"two different transporters are known to take extracellular folates, and some antifolates, into the cell."
4243,15655931L5,15655931,these are the reduced folate carrier and the folate receptor.
4244,15655931L6,15655931,one of the many attributes that make pemetrexed unique is that methodology has been developed to eliminate and control the many of its associated clinical toxicities.
4245,15655931L7,15655931,"multivariate analyses demonstrated that pretreatment total plasma homocysteine levels significantly predicted severe thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, with or without associated grade 3/4 diarrhea, mucositis, or infection."
4246,15655931L8,15655931,"routine vitamin b12 and folic acid supplementation have resulted in decreased frequency/severity of toxicities associated with pemetrexed without affecting efficacy, making this novel antifolate a safe and efficacious anticancer agent."
4247,28249679L0,28249679,"autophagy is a ubiquitous cellular mechanism for the targeted lysosomal degradation of various cytosolic constituents, from proteins to organelles."
4248,28249679L1,28249679,"as an essential homeostatic mechanism, autophagy is upregulated in response to numerous environmental and pharmacological stimuli, including starvation, where it facilitates the recycling of essential amino acids."
4249,28249679L2,28249679,"in addition, autophagy plays specific roles within the immune system; it serves as a source of peptides for antigen presentation, a mechanism for the engulfment and degradation of intracellular pathogens and as a key regulator of inflammatory cytokines."
4250,28249679L3,28249679,"in particular, autophagy has been shown to play a number of roles in regulating inflammasome activation, from the removal of inflammasome activating endogenous signals, to the sequestration and degradation of inflammasome components."
4251,28249679L4,28249679,"autophagy also plays a role in determining the fate of il 1β, which is concentrated in autophagosomes."
4252,28249679L5,28249679,this review discusses a growing body of literature that suggests autophagy is a critical regulator of inflammasome activation and the subsequent release of il 1 family cytokines.
4253,6263800L0,6263800,"the effects of levamisole, at concentrations known to stimulate neutrophil motility, on neutrophil post phagocytic metabolic activity were investigated."
4254,6263800L1,6263800,"levamisole at these concentrations caused inhibition of hexose monophosphate shunt (hms) activity, superoxide production, hydrogen peroxide generation and myeloperoxidase (mpo), mediated iodination of ingested candida albicans,."
4255,6263800L2,6263800,the inhibition of mpo mediated iodination was not solely due to lack of h2o availability as a result of decreased hms activity but also to a primary inhibition of iodination as shown in a cell free system with horse radish peroxidase (hrp) and added h2o2 and sodium iodide.
4256,6263800L3,6263800,further experiments were designed to investigate possible relationships between stimulation and motility and levamisole induced inhibition of superoxide generation and peroxidase mediated iodination.
4257,6263800L4,6263800,these showed that the peroxidase/halide/h2o2 system caused inactivation of both the leucoattractant and neutrophil chemotactic responsiveness.
4258,6263800L5,6263800,"however, concentrations of levamisole, which stimulate motility and inhibit superoxide production and peroxidase mediated iodination, protected both the leucoattractant response and the ability of the cell to respond to the leucoattractant from inactivation by the hrp/h2o2/iodide system."
4259,16483710L0,16483710,the mitogen activated protein kinase (map kinase) cascade system represents a highly conserved prototype of signal transduction by enzyme cascades.
4260,16483710L1,16483710,one of the best studied properties of the mapk system is its ability to convert graded input stimulus to switch like all or none responses.
4261,16483710L2,16483710,previous theoretical studies have centered on quantifying dual phosphorylated mapk as a final output response and have not incorporated its influence on the regulation of gene expression.
4262,16483710L3,16483710,"the main objective of the current work is to understand the regulatory effect of positive feedback loop embedded in the mapk cascade, nuclear translocation of active mapk, phosphorylation and activation of nuclear target proteins on the regulation of specific gene expression."
4263,16483710L4,16483710,"to achieve this objective, we have simulated the mapk cascade system, which resembles hog1p activation pathway in yeast, at steady state."
4264,16483710L5,16483710,"thus, the input signal to the mapk system is correlated with gene expression as a final system level output response."
4265,16483710L6,16483710,"the steady state simulation results suggest that other than regulating the signal propagation through cascades, the nuclear translocation of activated mapk and subsequent regulation of gene expression represent one of the key modes to control the threshold level of response."
4266,16483710L7,16483710,"this work proposes that, it is essential to consider the compartmental distributions of signaling species and the corresponding regulatory mechanisms of gene expression to study the system level performance of signaling modules such as the mapk cascade."
4267,16483710L8,16483710,such an analysis will relate the extracellular cues to the final phenotypic response by capturing the mechanistic details of the signaling pathway.

4269,10334645L1,10334645,"case control study carried out in spain that included 354 cases of gastric cancer and 354 controls, matched by age, gender, area of residence and hospital."
4270,10334645L2,10334645,usual food intake was assessed using a dietary history questionnaire.
4271,10334645L3,10334645,"in a multivariate model adjusted for several dietary factors, no association was found between intake of any of the studied carotenoids and the risk of gastric cancer."
4272,10334645L4,10334645,the adjusted or of gastric cancer for the highest quartile of total flavonoid intake versus the lowest quartile was 0.44 (95 percent confidence interval [ci] = 0.25 0.78; p for trend = 0.003).
4273,10334645L5,10334645,kaempferol intake was found to be protective (or = 0.48; ci = 0.26 0.88; p for trend = 0.04) comparing the highest versus the lowest quartile of intake.
4274,10334645L6,10334645,a trend toward lower risk of stomach cancer with higher intake of quercetin was also found.
4275,10334645L7,10334645,"the results of this study support the hypothesis that the well established protective effect of fruit and vegetables against gastric cancer could, in part, be due to the presence of flavonoids."
4276,29630677L0,29630677,"old yellow enzymes (oyes) are nad(p)h dehydrogenases of not fully resolved physiological roles that are widespread among bacteria, plants, and fungi and have a great potential for biotechnological applications."
4277,29630677L1,29630677,"we determined the apo form crystal structure of a member of the oye class, glycerol trinitrate reductase xdpb, from agrobacterium bohemicum r89 1 at 2.1 å resolution."
4278,29630677L2,29630677,"in agreement with the structures of the related bacterial oyes, the structure revealed the tim barrel fold with an n terminal β hairpin lid, but surprisingly, the structure did not contain its cofactor fmn."
4279,29630677L3,29630677,its putative binding site was occupied by a pentapeptide ttsdn from the c terminus of a symmetry related molecule.
4280,29630677L4,29630677,biochemical experiments confirmed a specific concentration dependent oligomerization and a low fmn content.
4281,29630677L5,29630677,the blocking of the fmn binding site can exist in vivo and regulates enzyme activity.
4282,29630677L6,29630677,our bioinformatic analysis indicated that a similar self inhibition could be expected in more oyes which we designated as subgroup oye c1.
4283,29630677L7,29630677,this subgroup is widespread among g bacteria and can be recognized by the conserved sequence gxxdyp in proximity of the c termini.
4284,29630677L8,29630677,"in proteobacteria, the c1 subgroup oyes are typically coded in one operon with short chain dehydrogenase."
4285,29630677L9,29630677,this operon is controlled by the tetr like transcriptional regulator.
4286,29630677L10,29630677,oyes coded in these operons are unlikely to be involved in the oxidative stress response as the other known members of the oye family because no upregulation of xdpb was observed after exposing a. bohemicum r89 1 to oxidative stress.
4287,2973346L0,2973346,"the levels of protein c, free protein s, c4b binding protein and the distribution of total protein s between a free form and a conjugated form with c4b binding protein, were measured in fetuses between 15 and 35 weeks of gestation, in newborns and in maternal blood throughout pregnancy."
4288,2973346L1,2973346,"fetal and newborn umbilical blood samples were obtained by cordocentesis; in the case of newborns, immediately after delivery."
4289,2973346L2,2973346,c4b binding protein was detected in five out of seven newborns and in only three out of 20 fetuses.
4290,2973346L3,2973346,"the fetuses (21, 24, 29 weeks, respectively) whose blood contained c4b binding protein (10%, 29%, 12% of adult level, respectively), did not survive: the possible cause of death for one was given as viral infection; all three were severely deformed."
4291,2973346L4,2973346,only free protein s was detected in fetal blood and the mean value was 40%.
4292,2973346L5,2973346,"by contrast, the mean levels of protein c in the fetuses increased from 11% to 15.5% of adult levels with advancing gestation."
4293,2973346L6,2973346,we conclude that the relatively high levels of free protein s in fetal blood may contribute to its non coagulability and compensate for the low protein c levels.
4294,27537764L0,27537764,remifentanil is used widely in clinical anesthesia because it induces more rapid and more common hyperalgesia than other opioid analgesics.
4295,27537764L1,27537764,activation of n methyl d aspartate (nmda) receptors takes a pivotal part in remifentanil induced hyperalgesia.
4296,27537764L2,27537764,"like nmda receptors, the α amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (ampars) are excitatory ion glutamate receptors in postsynaptic membrane, which are involved in the transmission of both acute and chronic pain."
4297,27537764L3,27537764,protein interacting with c kinase 1 (pick1) plays an important role in nmda receptor mediated internalization of glutamate receptor 2 (glur2) containing ampars and contributes to the induction and maintenance of inflammation induced pain.
4298,27537764L4,27537764,this study aimed to test the hypothesis that pick1 contributes to remifentanil induced hyperalgesia by regulating ampar expression and trafficking in the spinal cord.
4299,27537764L5,27537764,"using a rat model of remifentanil induced hyperalgesia by intravenous infusion of remifentanil, we first measured changes in mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia at 24 hours before remifentanil infusion and 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours after infusion."
4300,27537764L6,27537764,"pick1 mrna and protein expression and ampar subunit expression and trafficking in the spinal cord were then detected by reverse transcription qualitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and western blot."
4301,27537764L7,27537764,"in addition, we knocked down pick1 expression by intrathecal administration of pick1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to investigate the effects of pick1 deficiency on remifentanil induced hyperalgesia and the expression and trafficking of ampars."
4302,27537764L8,27537764,a significant time group interaction was found for nociceptive thresholds (paw withdrawal threshold and paw withdrawal latency; all p < .0001).
4303,27537764L9,27537764,"remifentanil infusion induced distinct hyperalgesia at different time points (p < .0001), which was partly reversed by pick1 knockdown (p < .007)."
4304,27537764L10,27537764,"besides, remifentanil infusion increased the expression of pick1 mrna and protein (p < .0001) and the membrane glur1 and glur2 internalization in spinal dorsal horn neurons (p < .0011)."
4305,27537764L11,27537764,"more importantly, pick1 deficiency could attenuate remifentanil induced glur2 internalization in the spinal cord dorsal horn (p < .01) but had no effect on remifentanil induced membrane glur1 expression (p ≥ .985)."
4306,27537764L12,27537764,these results indicate that pick1 deficiency might reverse remifentanil induced hyperalgesia through regulating glur2 containing ampar expression and trafficking in the spinal cord dorsal horn.
4307,19651218L0,19651218,"ferb is a flavoenzyme capable of reducing quinones, ferric complexes and chromate."
4308,19651218L1,19651218,its expression in escherichia coli as a hexahistidine fusion resulted in a functional product only when the tag was placed on the c terminus.
4309,19651218L2,19651218,"the molecular mass values estimated by gel permeation chromatography were compatible with the existence of either dimer or trimer, whereas the light scattering data, together with cross linking experiments that yielded exclusively monomer and dimer bands on dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, strongly supported a dimeric nature of both native and tagged form of ferb."
4310,19651218L3,19651218,these two proteins also exhibited almost identical secondary structure as judged by fourier transform infra red spectrometry.
4311,19651218L4,19651218,"the presence of tag, however, shifted the temperature of thermal inactivation as well as the thermal denaturation curve towards lower temperatures."
4312,19651218L5,19651218,"despite somewhat lower thermal stability, the fusion protein is considered a better candidate for crystallization than the wild type one due to a more negative value of its second optical viral coefficient."
4313,24586488L0,24586488,"the major maturity gene e1 has the most prominent effect on flowering time and photoperiod sensitivity of soybean, but the pathway mediated by e1 is largely unknown."
4314,24586488L1,24586488,"here, we found the expression of gmft4, a homolog of flowering locus t, was strongly up regulated in transgenic soybean overexpressing e1, whereas expression of flowering activators, gmft2a and gmft5a, was suppressed."
4315,24586488L2,24586488,"gmft4 expression was strongly up regulated by long days exhibiting a diurnal rhythm, but down regulated by short days."
4316,24586488L3,24586488,"notably, the basal expression level of gmft4 was elevated when transferred to continous light, whereas repressed when transferred to continuous dark."
4317,24586488L4,24586488,gmft4 was primarily expressed in fully expanded leaves.
4318,24586488L5,24586488,"transcript abundance of gmft4 was significantly correlated with that of functional e1, as well as flowering time phenotype in different cultivars."
4319,24586488L6,24586488,overexpression of gmft4 delayed the flowering time in transgenic arabidopsis.
4320,24586488L7,24586488,"taken together, we propose that gmft4 acts downstream of e1 and functions as a flowering repressor, and the balance of two antagonistic factors (gmft4 vs gmft2a/5a) determines the flowering time of soybean."
4321,10368077L0,10368077,"previously we proposed and provided evidence for the metabolic pathway of felbamate (fbm), which leads to the reactive metabolite, 3 carbamoyl 2 phenylpropion aldehyde."
4322,10368077L1,10368077,"this aldehyde carbamate was suggested to be the reactive intermediate in the oxidation of 2 phenyl 1,3 propanediol monocarbamate to the major human metabolite 3 carbamoyl 2 phenylpropionic acid."
4323,10368077L2,10368077,"in addition, the aldehyde carbamate was found to undergo spontaneous elimination to 2 phenylpropenal, commonly known as atropaldehyde."
4324,10368077L3,10368077,"moreover, atropaldehyde was proposed to play a role in the development of toxicity during fbm therapy."
4325,10368077L4,10368077,evidence for atropaldehyde formation in vivo was reported with the identification of modified n acetyl cysteine conjugates of atropaldehyde in both human and rat urine after fbm administration.
4326,10368077L5,10368077,identification of the atropaldehyde derived mercapturic acids in urine after fbm administration is consistent with the hypothesis that atropaldehyde is formed in vivo and that it reacts with thiol nucleophiles.
4327,10368077L6,10368077,"based on the hypothesis that the potential for toxicity will correlate to the amount of atropaldehyde formed, we sought to develop an analytic method that would quantify the amount of relevant metabolites excreted in patient urine."
4328,10368077L7,10368077,"we summarize the results of an lc/ms method used to quantify fbm, 3 carbamoyl 2 phenylpropionic acid and two atropaldehyde derived mercapturic acids in the patient population."
4329,10368077L8,10368077,analysis was performed on 31 patients undergoing fbm therapy.
4330,10368077L9,10368077,the absolute quantities of fbm and three metabolites were measured.
4331,10368077L10,10368077,"this method demonstrated sufficient precision for the identification of patients exhibiting ""abnormal"" levels of atropaldehyde conjugates and may hold potential for patient monitoring."
4332,18998582L0,18998582,there are several questions with regard to the application and possible side effects of external bleaching therapies.
4333,18998582L1,18998582,the following short review gives answers to some questions regarding this topic.
4334,18998582L2,18998582,it might be concluded that every bleaching therapy should be preceded by a meticulous intraoral examination.
4335,18998582L3,18998582,"to reduce the risk of adverse effects, it is mandatory to have knowledge about the mode of action of bleaching agents."
4336,22975675L0,22975675,"amphibian defensive skin secretions are complex species specific mixtures of biologically active molecules, including many uncharacterized peptides."
4337,22975675L1,22975675,"many of these peptides are post translationally modified and amongst the modifications discovered so far on amphibian defense peptides, disulfide bonds are quite frequently encountered."
4338,22975675L2,22975675,the presence of this ptm often complicates the ms based sequencing.
4339,22975675L3,22975675,here we demonstrate a method to target peptides containing inter/intra molecular s s bonds applying a ptm driven differential display.
4340,22975675L4,22975675,upon reduction of the disulfide bond both molecular mass and retention time of a peptide are altered.
4341,22975675L5,22975675,assembling the lc ms data by plotting the m/z data against retention time generates a peptide display and overlaying peptide displays of untreated and dtt reduced material yields a differential display.
4342,22975675L6,22975675,"from such an overlay, peptides originally carrying a disulfide bond are recognized due to the shift in both retention time and m/z values, whereas non cystine containing peptides remain unaltered in the differential display."
4343,22975675L7,22975675,"the success of this approach is demonstrated by the visualization of the cystines containing peptides in the skin secretion of odorrana schmackeri, phyllomedusa burmeisteri, phyllomedusa rohdei, kassina senegalensis, and bombina variegata."
4344,22975675L8,22975675,"the venoms from these different species yield complicated differential displays, showing interesting peptides, allowing one to target them for more detailed structural characterization."
4345,11003141L0,11003141,methanethiosulfonate reagents may be used to introduce virtually unlimited structural modifications in enzymes via reaction with the thiol group of cysteine.
4346,11003141L1,11003141,the covalent coupling of enantiomerically pure (r) and (s) chiral auxiliary methanethiosulfonate ligands to cysteine mutants of subtilisin bacillus lentus induces spectacular changes in catalytic activity between diastereomeric enzymes.
4347,11003141L2,11003141,"amidase and esterase kinetic assays using a low substrate approximation were used to establish kcat/km values for the chemically modified mutants, and up to 3 fold differences in activity were found between diastereomeric enzymes."
4348,11003141L3,11003141,changing the length of the carbon chain linking the phenyl or benzyl oxazolidinone ligand to the mutant n62c by a methylene unit reverses which diastereomeric enzyme is more active.
4349,11003141L4,11003141,"similarly, changing from a phenyl to benzyl oxazolidinone ligand at s166c reverses which diastereomeric enzyme is more active."
4350,11003141L5,11003141,chiral modifications at s166c and l217c give cmms having both high esterase kcat/km's and high esterase to amidase ratios with large differences between diastereomeric enzymes.
4351,23742913L0,23742913,"depletion of circulating cd4(+) t helper (th) lymphocytes, especially naive th cells, is common in cirrhosis."
4352,23742913L1,23742913,little is known about the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in th cell depletion in cirrhosis.
4353,23742913L2,23742913,we investigated the mechanisms involved in circulating th cell lymphopenia in cirrhosis.
4354,23742913L3,23742913,circulating naive and memory th cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in 60 patients with cirrhosis and 40 sex  and age matched healthy controls.
4355,23742913L4,23742913,"thymopoiesis, apoptosis, cell activation, and proliferation were assessed through cd31, annexin v, hla dr and ki 67 expression, respectively."
4356,23742913L5,23742913,"lipopolysaccharide (lps) binding protein (lbp) and spleen size were measured as indicators of bacterial translocation and splenic pooling, respectively."
4357,23742913L6,23742913,"compared to controls, patients showed reduced numbers of th cells involving a greater depletion of the naive than memory th cell compartment (2.7  vs. 1.5 fold, respectively)."
4358,23742913L7,23742913,"recent thymic emigrants were diminished (p < 0.01), and each patient had a lower number of cd31(+) naive th cells than the matched control."
4359,23742913L8,23742913,spontaneous and induced apoptosis (annexin v(+)) of th cells was increased in patients.
4360,23742913L9,23742913,"activated (hla dr(+)) and proliferating (ki 67(+)) memory th cells were increased in patients (p < 0.01), and they directly correlated with plasma lbp (p < 0.05) and negatively with naive th cells (p < 0.01), respectively."
4361,23742913L10,23742913,"naive th cells were inversely correlated (p < 0.01) with their frequencies of apoptosis and of activated memory th cells, lbp, and spleen size."
4362,23742913L11,23742913,"on multivariate analysis, defective thymic generation of naive th cells, increased memory th cell activation, and splenomegaly were independently associated with th cell depletion."
4363,23742913L12,23742913,th cell immunodeficiency in cirrhosis is explained by a universal defect in thymopoiesis exacerbated by splenic pooling and activation driven cell death induced by bacterial translocation.
4364,9837710L0,9837710,"despite proline being assumed to be a helix breaker, a large number of alpha helices are found to contain pro in globular as well as membrane proteins."
4365,9837710L1,9837710,proline has no free nh group and therefore cannot form the conventional intra helical nh.o=c hydrogen bond.
4366,9837710L2,9837710,"an analysis of known protein structures has shown that the cdelta protons are involved in c  h...o hydrogen bonds, usually two, with the carbonyl groups in the preceding turn of the helix (four and three residues away)."
4367,9837710L3,9837710,"these interactions satisfy the hydrogen bond forming potential of the carbonyl groups, which would otherwise, in the case of membrane bound helices, be unfavorably exposed to hydrophobic surroundings."
4368,9837710L4,9837710,"depending on the type (based on the location of the carbonyl group, usually three, four or five residues preceding pro) of c  h...o interactions, the kink in the helix may be of different magnitude."
4369,9837710L5,9837710,"the puckering (up or down) of the pyrrolidine ring of pro residues is controlled by the type of the c  h...o bond present, and the form that provides a better hydrogen bond geometry is preferred."

4371,15298667L1,15298667,the most ubiquitous action of melatonin is that of a free radical scavenger.
4372,15298667L2,15298667,"therefore, we investigated the action of melatonin by monitoring changes in the tone on ring preparations from human internal mammary arteries (ima)."
4373,15298667L3,15298667,in quiescent ima rings melatonin (0.1 nm 10 microm) never elicited any change in baseline tension but 1 100 nm melatonin enhanced significantly maximal responses to noradrenaline (na) in arteries with endothelial function.
4374,15298667L4,15298667,"in na (1 microm) precontracted arteries inhibition of nitric oxide (no(*)) formation by n(g) monomethyl l arginine (l nmma, 100 and 400 microm) eliminated 43 +/  7 and 61 +/  7% of the acetylcholine (ach) effect."
4375,15298667L5,15298667,melatonin (100 and 400 nm) attenuated maximal endothelium dependent relaxant responses to ach slightly by 23 +/  9 and 17 +/  9% leaving responses to direct stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase by sodium nitroprusside unchanged.
4376,15298667L6,15298667,"incubation of ima for 20 hr at 37 degrees c with 1 microg/ml lipopolysaccharide (lps) enhanced maximal na effects to 147 +/  18% (n = 22, p < 0.01) whereas 50 microg/ml lps reduced the na maxima to 68 +/  9% (n = 10, p < 0.01) of the control effects."
4377,15298667L7,15298667,the lps induced potentiation was completely attenuated by coincubation with melatonin (400 nm) and significantly reduced by coincubation with the thromboxane synthase inhibitor dazoxiben (10 microm).
4378,15298667L8,15298667,it is suggested that the lps induced hyperreactivity of vascular smooth muscle is mediated through enhanced release of ros and prostanoids and that melatonin inhibits the vascular hyperreactivity through selective scavenging of ros.
4379,29555325L0,29555325,"our objective was to figure out whether cyp2d6 gene polymorphisms may account for long term tramadol induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity in 60 patients receiving chronic tramadol treatment in neurology and rheumatology outpatients clinic, zagazig university hospitals, egypt."
4380,29555325L1,29555325,"as expected, cyp2d6*1 allele (wild type) frequency was significantly greater than cyp2d6*dup, cyp2d6*4 and cyp2d6*10 alleles in both chronically tramadol treated and control groups."
4381,29555325L2,29555325,"in tramadol treated patients, cyp2d6*dup allele carriers followed by those carrying cyp2d6*1, displayed higher levels of urinary tramadol major active metabolite, o desmethyltramadol (m1) and serum lipid peroxidation along with lower levels of total antioxidants than those carrying other impaired function alleles (cyp2d6*4&*10), suggesting oxidative stress."
4382,29555325L3,29555325,there were also significant increases in serum hepatic damage markers including alpha glutathione transferase (α gst) levels and liver function enzyme activities in *dup and *1 carriers compared to carriers of other alleles.
4383,29555325L4,29555325,"moreover, we reported that in 42 patients with allele *1, tramadol caused mild to moderate hepatotoxicity (grades: 1 2) within 13 16 months while in 7 patients with duplicated allele (*dup), tramadol caused moderate to severe hepatotoxicity (grades: 2 3) within 10 11 months (moderately longer period but shorter than that observed in allele *1), implying that exposure to tramadol for longer time in extensive and ultra rapid metabolizers may contribute to hepatotoxicity development."
4384,29555325L5,29555325,"overall, our results suggest that cyp2d6 gene polymorphisms, particularly enhanced or normal function of cyp2d6, may increase the vulnerability to long term tramadol induced hepatotoxicity through the enhancement of accumulation of tramadol bioactive metabolite (m1) and hence oxidative stress."
4385,29555325L6,29555325,"therefore, tramadol doses should be adjusted according to patient's cyp2d6 genotyping analysis to avoid hepatotoxicity."

4395,19121570L9,19121570,application of uti not only protected the small intestine from sepsis but also diminished changes of intestinal mast cells.
4396,19121570L10,19121570,uti can significantly ameliorate the small intestinal injury and subsequent bacterial translocation by inhibiting mast cells degranulation in septic rats.

4409,17077385L2,17077385,the present work is part of an effort to understand the causes and mechanisms underlying these adaptations.
4410,17077385L3,17077385,we observed that an extract of human urine (hdlu) increases ter in a concentration  and time dependent manner and is more effective when added from the basolateral side of cultured monolayers of madin darby canine kidney cells than from the apical one.
4411,17077385L4,17077385,"we found that its main ter increasing component is epidermal growth factor (hegf), as depletion of this peptide with specific antibodies, or inhibition of its receptor with pd153035, abolishes its effect."
4412,17077385L5,17077385,"since the permeability of the tj depends on the expression of several species of membrane proteins, chiefly claudins, we explored whether hdlu can affect five members of the claudin family, the three known members of the zo family, and occludin."
4413,17077385L6,17077385,"egf present in hdlu decreases the content of claudins 1 and  2 as well as delocalizes them from the tj and increases the content of claudin 4. as expected from the fact that the degree of sealing of the tj must be a physiologically regulated parameter, besides of hegf, we also found that hdlu appears to contain also other components that decrease ter, claudin 4 and  7, and that seem to act with different kinetics than the ter increasing ones."

4425,24238127L2,24238127,rats were treated with sitagliptin (10mg/kg/day or 30 mg/kg/day) for six weeks.
4426,24238127L3,24238127,chronic l name administration resulted in depletion of serum nitric oxide (no) associated with elevation in the mean arterial pressure.
4427,24238127L4,24238127,"when compared with the control group; serum urea, serum creatinine, albuminuria, urinary n acetyl ß d glucosaminidase (nag) level and renal tissue malondialdhyde (mda) content were significantly elevated, while creatinine clearance, serum level of glucagon like peptide 1 (glp 1) as well as renal tissue superoxide dismutase (sod) and glutathione peroxidase (gsh px) activities were signifcantly decreased in l name treated group."
4428,24238127L5,24238127,renal expression of mrna for enos and glp 1 receptors were reduced in the l name treated group as compared with the control group.
4429,24238127L6,24238127,treatment with sitagliptin (10mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) successfully ameliorated the deleterious effects of l name on the all tested parameters.
4430,24238127L7,24238127,our study indicates a novel protective effect of sitagliptin against l name induced hypertensive nephropathy.
4431,24238127L8,24238127,"an effect which is mediated through, increasing serum level of glp 1, upregulation of glp 1 receptors, which in turn, lead to induction of expression enos, increased serum no level, tandem with decreased lipid perodixation and restore the antioxidant defense mechanisms."
4432,24238127L9,24238127,it is worth mentioning that the effects produced by sitaglipin (30 mg/kg) were superior to the effects obtained by the lower dose.
4433,6345794L0,6345794,presecretory signal peptides of 39 proteins from diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources have been compared.
4434,6345794L1,6345794,"although varying in length and amino acid composition, the labile peptides share a hydrophobic core of approximately 12 amino acids."
4435,6345794L2,6345794,a positively charged residue (lys or arg) usually precedes the hydrophobic core.
4436,6345794L3,6345794,"core termination is defined by the occurrence of a charged residue, a sequence of residues which may induce a beta turn in a polypeptide, or an interruption in potential alpha helix or beta extended strand structure."
4437,6345794L4,6345794,"the hydrophobic cores contain, by weight average, 37% leu: 15% ala: 10% val: 10% phe: 7% ile plus 21% other hydrophobic amino acids arranged in a non random sequence."
4438,6345794L5,6345794,"following the hydrophobic cores (aligned by their last residue) a highly non random and localized distribution of ala is apparent within the initial eight positions following the core: (formula; see text) coincident with this observation, ala x ala is the most frequent sequence preceding signal peptidase cleavage."
4439,6345794L6,6345794,we propose the existence of a signal peptidase recognition sequence a x b with the preferred cleavage site located after the sixth amino acid following the core sequence.
4440,6345794L7,6345794,twenty two of the above 27 underlined ala residues would participate as a or b in peptidase cleavage.
4441,6345794L8,6345794,"position a includes the larger aliphatic amino acids, leu, val and ile, as well as the residues already found at b (principally ala, gly and ser)."
4442,6345794L9,6345794,since a preferred cleavage site can be discerned from carboxyl and not amino terminal alignment of the hydrophobic cores it is proposed that the carboxyl ends are oriented inward toward the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where cleavage is thought to occur.
4443,6345794L10,6345794,this orientation coupled with the predicted beta turn typically found between the core and the cleavage site implies reverse hairpin insertion of the signal sequence.
4444,6345794L11,6345794,the structural features which we describe should help identify signal peptides and cleavage sites in presumptive amino acid sequences derived from dna sequences.
4445,8522731L0,8522731,improper treatment and disposal of pesticide contaminated wastewaters raise concerns for soil and water contamination.
4446,8522731L1,8522731,"based on the pilot studies described here, chemical treatment via fenton's reagent (ferrous ion plus hydrogen peroxide) of three organophosphorus insecticides in aqueous solution appears promising."
4447,8522731L2,8522731,"results show that the fenton dark reaction degrades methyl parathion, malathion, and methamidophos, and in many cases their breakdown products as well."
4448,8522731L3,8522731,addition of cupric ion greatly accelerates insecticide disappearance.
4449,8522731L4,8522731,"to maximize degradation, further studies of the influence of 1) pesticide structure, 2) reagent ratios, and 3) breakdown product competition on reaction rates are necessary."
4450,2741114L0,2741114,"examination of 155 patients with atopic, infection dependent bronchial asthma (ba) and chronic asthmatic bronchitis in the phase of the disease exacerbation and remission has shown that hyperhistaminemia is common not only to atopic but also to infection dependent ba."
4451,2741114L1,2741114,"it is established that activation of lipid peroxidation of the membranes more pronounced during exacerbation and attacks of asthma is one of the most important alternative mechanisms of mast cell activation, that is supported by the data of experimental morphologic and biochemical studies of the effect exerted by peroxidized fatty acids on histamine liberation and mast cell degranulation."
4452,18262543L0,18262543,"several antibody fragment engineering techniques aim at intrinsic stability enhancement, but are not applied in a truly generic way."
4453,18262543L1,18262543,"here, a strategy is proposed whereby consistent gain in stability is accomplished by introducing a specific disulfide bond between two opposite beta strands in the hydrophobic core of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain of heavy chain antibodies (nanobody)."
4454,18262543L2,18262543,"besides the rational design of a disulfide bond between residues 39 and 87, a nanobody harboring an extra naturally occurring cystine between residues 54 and 78 was compared to an equivalent nanobody without that cystine."
4455,18262543L3,18262543,both novel disulfide cross links were introduced in several nanobodies in various combinations.
4456,18262543L4,18262543,"interestingly, only the extra naturally occurring cystine consistently increased the conformational and thermal stabilities of wild type nanobodies without affecting antigen binding."
4457,8128226L0,8128226,"the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (cpds), dna lesions induced by ultraviolet light, was studied at nucleotide resolution."
4458,8128226L1,8128226,human fibroblasts were irradiated with ultraviolet light and allowed to repair.
4459,8128226L2,8128226,"the dna was enzymatically cleaved at the cpds, and the induced breaks along the promoter and exon 1 of the pgk1 gene were mapped by ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction."
4460,8128226L3,8128226,"repair rates within the nontranscribed strand varied as much as 15 fold, depending on nucleotide position."
4461,8128226L4,8128226,preferential repair of the transcribed strand began just downstream of the transcription start site but was most pronounced beginning at nucleotide +140 in exon 1. the promoter contained two slowly repaired regions that coincided with two transcription factor binding sites.
4462,17540466L0,17540466,"although glucocorticoids are frequently administered to patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer, their therapeutic effectiveness is limited by the development of glucocorticoid resistance."
4463,17540466L1,17540466,the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance are unknown but are believed to involve neuropeptide growth factors and cytokines.
4464,17540466L2,17540466,we examined the functional interaction between bombesin and dexamethasone in pc 3 cells and found that bombesin could act as a survival factor by interfering with dexamethasone mediated growth inhibition.
4465,17540466L3,17540466,"because glucocorticoids exert their effects through glucocorticoid receptors (grs), we measured the expression of gr alpha and gr beta isoforms in the presence of bombesin."
4466,17540466L4,17540466,"western blotting and real time pcr revealed bombesin induced expression of gr beta, but not gr alpha."
4467,17540466L5,17540466,"because gr isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of a common gr gene, we examined the expression of serine arginine (sr) proteins involved in alternative splicing, and found that the expression of srp30 was induced by bombesin in pc 3 cells."
4468,17540466L6,17540466,"to characterize the role of srp30 in splicing of gr isoforms, sirnas specific to various srp30 isoforms were transfected into pc 3 cells."
4469,17540466L7,17540466,"we found that suppression of srp30c expression by sirna specifically antagonized bombesin's effect on glucocorticoid mediated inhibition of pc cells, suggesting that bombesin induced expression of srp30c affects gr pre mrna splicing, leading to increased gr beta expression and contributing to glucocorticoid resistance in pc cells."
4470,24242245L0,24242245,"the aims of this study were to develop strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) having both immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties and to evaluate their anti inflammatory effects both in vitro, in different cellular models, and in vivo, in a mouse model of colitis."
4471,24242245L1,24242245,different lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
4472,24242245L2,24242245,bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus strains were cocultured with primary cultures of mononuclear cells.
4473,24242245L3,24242245,analysis of the pro  and anti inflammatory cytokines secreted by these cells after coincubation with candidate bacteria revealed that l. delbrueckii subsp.
4474,24242245L4,24242245,bulgaricus crl 864 and s. thermophilus crl 807 display the highest anti inflammatory profiles in vitro.
4475,24242245L5,24242245,"moreover, these results were confirmed in vivo by the determination of the cytokine profiles in large intestine samples of mice fed with these strains."
4476,24242245L6,24242245,"s. thermophilus crl 807 was then transformed with two different plasmids harboring the genes encoding catalase (cat) or superoxide dismutase (sod) antioxidant enzymes, and the anti inflammatory effects of recombinant streptococci were evaluated in a mouse model of colitis induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (tnbs)."
4477,24242245L7,24242245,"our results showed a decrease in weight loss, lower liver microbial translocation, lower macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, and modulation of the cytokine production in the large intestines of mice treated with either cat  or sod producing streptococci compared to those in mice treated with the wild type strain or control mice without any treatment."
4478,24242245L8,24242245,"furthermore, the greatest anti inflammatory activity was observed in mice receiving a mixture of both cat  and sod producing streptococci."
4479,24242245L9,24242245,the addition of l. delbrueckii subsp.
4480,24242245L10,24242245,bulgaricus crl 864 to this mixture did not improve their beneficial effects.
4481,24242245L11,24242245,"these findings show that genetically engineering a candidate bacterium (e.g., s. thermophilus crl 807) with intrinsic immunomodulatory properties by introducing a gene expressing an antioxidant enzyme enhances its anti inflammatory activities."
4482,8121549L0,8121549,nervous system specific transcription factors that bind to the octameric deoxyribonucleic acid sequence motif atgcaaat (or atttgcat) are known as n oct proteins.
4483,8121549L1,8121549,"neurons and glia contain the ubiquitous oct 1 protein and four polypeptide complexes termed n oct 2, n oct 3, n oct 4, and n oct 5. previously, we showed that n oct proteins are differentially expressed by human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines in vitro."
4484,8121549L2,8121549,we have now extended this work to freshly isolated human primary and metastatic brain tumors.
4485,8121549L3,8121549,"contrary to brain tumor cell lines, of the five astrocytomas and three glioblastomas analyzed, all but two tumors displayed the complete n oct protein profile, irrespective of histopathological tumor grade."
4486,8121549L4,8121549,"two astrocytomas were negative for n oct 4. ten of 13 ependymomas exhibited n oct 2, n oct 3, and n oct 4 but lacked the n oct 5 complex."
4487,8121549L5,8121549,"in contrast, brain metastases of two patients with extracerebral carcinomas contained only oct 1, and cerebral metastases from two cases of b cell lymphomas showed oct 1 and oct 2 complexes, the characteristic oct protein pattern of b lymphocytes."
4488,8121549L6,8121549,"thus, metastatic carcinoma and lymphoma expressed a non nervous system phenotype of oct proteins."
4489,16081425L0,16081425,"glutamate cysteine ligase (gcl), which synthesizes gamma glutamyl cysteine (gamma gc), is the rate limiting enzyme in gsh biosynthesis."
4490,16081425L1,16081425,"gamma gc may be produced by the catalytic subunit gclc or by the holoenzyme (gclholo), which comprises gclc and the modifier subunit gclm."
4491,16081425L2,16081425,the gclm( / ) knock out mouse shows tissue levels of gsh that are between 9 and 40% of the gclm(+/+) wild type mouse.
4492,16081425L3,16081425,"in the present study, we used recombinant gclc and gclm and gclm( / ) mice to examine the role of gclm on gamma gc synthesis by gclholo."
4493,16081425L4,16081425,"gclm decreased the km for atp by approximately 6 fold and, similar to other species, decreased the km for glutamate and increased the ki for feedback inhibition by gsh."
4494,16081425L5,16081425,"furthermore, gclm increased by 4.4 fold the kcat for gamma gc synthesis; this difference in catalytic efficiency of gclholo versus gclc allowed us to derive a mathematical relationship for gamma gc production and to determine the relative levels of gclholo and gclc; in homogenates of brain, liver, and lung, the ratio of gclc to gclholo was 7.0, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively."
4495,16081425L6,16081425,"in kidney, however, the relationship between gclc and gclholo was complicated."
4496,16081425L7,16081425,"kidney contains gclholo, free gclc, and free gclm, and free gclc in kidney cannot interact with gclm."
4497,16081425L8,16081425,"taken together, we conclude that, in most tissues, gclm is limiting, suggesting that an increase in gclm alone would increase gamma gc synthesis."
4498,16081425L9,16081425,"on the other hand, our results from kidney suggest that gamma gc synthesis may be controlled post translationally."
4499,10323080L0,10323080,we investigated the frequency and mutual relationship of molecular alterations in 33 malignant astrocytomas (28 glioblastomas and 5 anaplastic astrocytomas).
4500,10323080L1,10323080,"the genetic alterations analyzed were: deletion of cdkn2a/p16 gene, tp53 mutations, and amplification of egfr, mdm2 and cdk4."
4501,10323080L2,10323080,the most common genetic alteration was egfr amplification which was revealed in 15 cases (45%).
4502,10323080L3,10323080,tp53 mutation was identified in 9 cases (27%) and cdkn2/p16 deletion was detected in 13 cases (41%).
4503,10323080L4,10323080,"either mdm2 and cdk4 amplifications were less frequent, as they were identified in 4 (12%) and 1 (3%) case, respectively."
4504,10323080L5,10323080,"of the 15 cases showing the amplification of egfr, 9 had cdkn2/p16 deletion (60%, p = 0.04)."
4505,10323080L6,10323080,"on the other hand, cdkn2/p16 deletion and egfr amplification rarely occurred with tp53 mutations (2 of 14 cases with cdkn2/p16 deletion, 14%)."
4506,10323080L7,10323080,these results confirm the existence of at least two different pathways leading to the formation of a glioblastoma.

4509,18269878L2,18269878,the expression of rip140 was examined by immunohistochemistry.
4510,18269878L3,18269878,real time pcr and western blotting were used to quantify the expression of the mrna and protein levels of rip140.
4511,18269878L4,18269878,"(1) immunochemistry showed that rip140 was expressed extensively in the brain of embryonic and newborn mice, mainly present in the neurons in many different brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and pituitary gland."
4512,18269878L5,18269878,the cellular location of rip140 was confined to the nucleus.
4513,18269878L6,18269878,"(2) real time pcr revealed that the rip140 mrna expression in brain was in an increment as the time went by, peaked on the 7th day after birth, then was in a instable level after that until the adulthood."
4514,18269878L7,18269878,"(3) western blotting indicated that the protein level of rip140 was coincident with the mrna level [r(s) = 0.767, p = 0.016 (bilateral)]."
4515,18269878L8,18269878,"the expression and role of rip140 may be involved in the whole neurodevelopment stages of brain, and may take part in the development and the function of the brain."
4516,16218874L0,16218874,the contributions of the authors to the research program 'radicals in enzymatic catalysis' over the last ca.
4517,16218874L1,16218874,5 years are summarized.
4518,16218874L2,16218874,"significant efforts were directed towards the design and testing of phenol containing ligands for synthesizing radical containing transition metal complexes as potential candidates for catalysis of organic substrates like alcohols, amines, aminophenols and catechols."
4519,16218874L3,16218874,"functional models for different copper oxidases, such as galactose oxidase, amine oxidases, phenoxazinone synthase and catechol oxidase, are reported."
4520,16218874L4,16218874,the copper complexes synthesized can mimic the function of the metalloenzymes galactose oxidase and amine oxidases by catalyzing the aerial oxidation of alcohols and amines.
4521,16218874L5,16218874,"even methanol could be oxidized, albeit with a low conversion, by a biradical copper(ii) compound."
4522,16218874L6,16218874,"the presence of a primary kinetic isotope effect, similar to that for galactose oxidase, provides compelling evidence that h atom abstraction from the alpha c atom of the substrates is the rate limiting step."
4523,16218874L7,16218874,"although catechol oxidase and phenoxazinone synthase contain copper, manganese(iv) complexes containing radicals have been found to be useful to study synthetic systems and to understand the naturally occurring processes."
4524,16218874L8,16218874,an 'on off' mechanism of the radicals without redox participation from the metal centers seems to be operative in the catalysis involving such metal radical complexes.
4525,24365513L0,24365513,"arterial aging is the major contributing factor to increases in the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, due mainly to the presence of chronic, low grade, 'sterile' arterial inflammation."
4526,24365513L1,24365513,inflammatory signaling driven by the angiotensin ii cascade perpetrates adverse age associated arterial structural and functional remodeling.
4527,24365513L2,24365513,"the aged artery is characterized by endothelial disruption, enhanced vascular smooth muscle cell (vmsc) migration and proliferation, extracellular matrix (ecm) deposition, elastin fracture, and matrix calcification/amyloidosis/glycation."
4528,24365513L3,24365513,"importantly, the molecular mechanisms of arterial aging are also relevant to the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis."
4529,24365513L4,24365513,"age associated arterial proinflammation is to some extent mutable, and interventions to suppress or delay it may have the potential to ameliorate or retard age associated arterial diseases."
4530,20132022L0,20132022,preeclampsia can have significant impact on health of both mother and fetus.
4531,20132022L1,20132022,it had been proposed that maternal endothelial cell dysfunction is the key event resulting in the diverse clinical manifestations of preeclampsia and evidence has since accumulated.
4532,20132022L2,20132022,research in recent times is indicative of the role of oxidative stress in the endothelial cell dysfunction.
4533,20132022L3,20132022,preeclampsia is more common in first pregnancy and studies have further shown an increase in risk of preeclampsia with maternal age.
4534,20132022L4,20132022,the aim of this study was to explore the status of oxidative stress in higher age group preeclamptic and normal pregnant mother.
4535,20132022L5,20132022,the study included 20 normal pregnant women and 60 preeclamptic women.
4536,20132022L6,20132022,"they were allocated into 4 subgroups between ages 20 25, 26 30, 31 35, and 36 40. erythrocytes were analyzed for the following antioxidant enzymes, i.e., glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase.lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, was analyzed to determine oxidative stress."
4537,20132022L7,20132022,"the results showed an increase in oxidative stress, and high magnitude suppression/decrease in antioxidant enzymes activities in erythrocytes with increase in age groups in both preeclamptic and normal pregnant women."
4538,20132022L8,20132022,this indicates that an increase in the risk of preeclampsia with maternal age could be due to an increase in oxidative stress with age.
4539,20132022L9,20132022,this further attests to the role of oxidative stress in preeclampsia.
4540,18646200L0,18646200,"when covalently attaching biomolecules to surfaces such as titanium, trifunctional silanes are commonly used as primers to produce surface amine groups."
4541,18646200L1,18646200,"however, these primed surfaces are rarely uniform in structure due to networking of the silane."
4542,18646200L2,18646200,"mono functional aminosilanes may result in more uniform structures, although their long term stability and effect on osteoblast cell responses are possible issues for orthopedic applications."
4543,18646200L3,18646200,this study examines for the first time the optimization of peptide coupling to titanium using mono functional aminosilane reaction chemistry.
4544,18646200L4,18646200,"the resultant surface topography, chemistry, and thicknesses were characterized showing improved surface uniformity compared with trifunctional silanized surfaces."
4545,18646200L5,18646200,"the stability of the coatings was examined over a period of 8 days in environments of varying ph, temperature, and humidity."
4546,18646200L6,18646200,"in addition, human osteosarcoma (hos) cell adhesion and spreading on the samples was examined; adhesion was minimal on silanized surfaces, but after functionalization with cysteine the cell density was greater than the titanium control and showed no overall detrimental effect on initial cell responses."
4547,27830829L0,27830829,trichoderma harzianum is well known to exhibit induced systemic resistance (isr) to curvularia leaf spot.
4548,27830829L1,27830829,"we previously reported that a c6 zinc finger protein (thc6) is responsible for a major contribution to the isr to the leaf disease, but the types of effectors and the signals mediated by thc6 from trichoderma are unclear."
4549,27830829L2,27830829,"in this work, we demonstrated that two hydrolases, thph1 and thph2, from t. harzianum were regulated by thc6."
4550,27830829L3,27830829,"furthermore, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) study revealed that thc6 regulated mrna expression by binding to ggctaa and ggctaaa in the promoters of the thph1 and thph2 genes, respectively."
4551,27830829L4,27830829,"moreover, the thph1 and thph2 proteins triggered the transient production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and elevated the free cytosolic calcium levels in maize leaf."
4552,27830829L5,27830829,"furthermore, the genes related to the jasmonate/ethylene signaling pathway were up regulated in the wild type maize strain."
4553,27830829L6,27830829,"however, the δthph1  or δthph2 deletion mutants could not activate the immune defense related genes in maize to protect against leaf disease."
4554,27830829L7,27830829,"therefore, we conclude that functional thph1 and thph2 may be required in t. harzianum to activate isr in maize."
4555,11675153L0,11675153,"the contribution of the nm23 h1 gene to metastasis in malignant tumors, including gastric cancer, is controversial."
4556,11675153L1,11675153,"in this study, we compared nm23 h1 levels in two cell subtypes with different morphologies (floating and adherent states), but that were derived from the same gastric cancer cell line, kato iii."
4557,11675153L2,11675153,a real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the number of nm23 h1 mrna molecules in floating cells was significantly higher than that in adherent cells (p<0.0001).
4558,11675153L3,11675153,the average of the copies in floating cells was approximately 2.4 fold higher than that in adherent cells.
4559,11675153L4,11675153,"consistent with mrna levels, intracellular levels of nm23 h1 protein were higher in floating cells than in adherent cells."
4560,11675153L5,11675153,there was no difference in cell cycle characteristics between the two subtypes.
4561,11675153L6,11675153,"in conclusion, our present data indicate that expression of nm23 h1 by a tumor could be altered during the different steps in metastases, suggesting that nm23 h1 may act as a molecular switch between the free floating and adherent states of cancer cells."
4562,15681594L0,15681594,"the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) is a ligand activated transcription factor that mediates immunosuppression induced by a variety of ubiquitous environmental pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins."
4563,15681594L1,15681594,"although the normal physiological role for the ahr in the absence of environmental chemicals is uncertain, recent studies suggest its contribution to cell growth and apoptosis."
4564,15681594L2,15681594,"because b cells seem to be directly affected by ahr ligands in animal models, it was postulated that the ahr is predominantly expressed in activated human b cells and that it may contribute to cell growth regulation."
4565,15681594L3,15681594,"to begin to address these issues and to extend detailed analyses of ahr function to a human system, ahr expression in resting and activated human b cells was studied."
4566,15681594L4,15681594,"in addition, the response of activated b cells to an environmental ahr ligand was investigated to provide insight into a possible physiological role for the ahr."
4567,15681594L5,15681594,resting peripheral human b cells expressed little or no ahr.
4568,15681594L6,15681594,"however, activation with cpg or cd40 ligand profoundly up regulated ahr mrna and protein."
4569,15681594L7,15681594,"ahr nuclear translocation, constitutive dna binding, and induction of an ahr regulated gene, cyp1a1, in stimulated b cells in the absence of exogenous ligands suggested constitutive ahr activation."
4570,15681594L8,15681594,cell division was not required for ahr up regulation.
4571,15681594L9,15681594,"treatment of ahr expressing b cells with a prototypic environmental ahr ligand, benzo[a]pyrene, significantly suppressed cell growth."
4572,15681594L10,15681594,these data help explain the sensitivity of b cells to environmental ahr ligands and strongly suggest that the ahr plays an important function within the human b cell compartment.
4573,11911242L0,11911242,green tea polyphenols are known to induce apoptosis in certain types of tumor cells.
4574,11911242L1,11911242,"however, the mechanism(s) that enables normal cells to evade the apoptotic effect is still not understood."
4575,11911242L2,11911242,"in this study, western blot analysis combined with cycloheximide treatment was used to examine the effects of green tea polyphenols on the expression levels of p57, a cyclin dependent kinase and apoptosis inhibitor, in normal human keratinocytes and in the oral carcinoma cell lines scc25 and osc2."
4576,11911242L3,11911242,"the results showed that the most potent green tea polyphenol, ( ) epigallocatechin 3 gallate (egcg), induced p57 in normal keratinocytes in a dosage  and time dependent manner, while the levels of p57 protein in oral carcinoma cells were unaltered."
4577,11911242L4,11911242,the differential response in p57 induction was consistent with the apoptosis status detected by annexin v assay.
4578,11911242L5,11911242,the data suggest that the chemopreventive effects of green tea polyphenols may involve p57 mediated cell cycle regulation in normal epithelial cells.

4585,16650608L6,16650608,staining for tunel and neun was colocalized throughout the striatum.
4586,16650608L7,16650608,meth induces apoptosis in approximately 25% of striatal neurons.
4587,16650608L8,16650608,"cell counts of tunel positive neurons in the dorsomedial, ventromedial, dorsolateral and ventrolateral quadrants of the striatum did not reveal anatomical preference."

4590,16650608L11,16650608,"in contrast, the sst positive interneurons were refractory to meth induced apoptosis."
4591,16650608L12,16650608,"finally, the amount of cell loss determined with nissl staining correlated with the amount of tunel staining in the striatum of meth treated animals."
4592,16650608L13,16650608,"in conclusion, some of the striatal projection neurons and the gaba parvalbumin and cholinergic interneurons were removed by apoptosis in the aftermath of meth."
4593,16650608L14,16650608,this imbalance in the populations of striatal neurons may lead to functional abnormalities in the output and processing of neural information in this part of the brain.

4596,1475777L2,1475777,we used a well characterized cylindrical perfusion chamber to study the effect of ajoene on platelet deposition onto physiological substrates such as pig aortic subendothelium and tunica media as a model of mildly and severely damaged vessel wall respectively.
4597,1475777L3,1475777,experiments were performed under flow conditions of high and low shear rate that mimic laminar blood flow in small and medium size arteries (1690 sec 1 and 212 sec 1).
4598,1475777L4,1475777,our results indicate that ajoene prevents thrombus formation both at low and high shear rate in citrated whole blood.
4599,1475777L5,1475777,"the inhibitory effect of ajoene on platelet thrombus formation seems to be dependent on its inhibition of fibrinogen binding, since significantly higher concentrations of ajoene are needed to affect von willebrand factor binding to gpiib/iiia receptors."
4600,1475777L6,1475777,"further, ajoene does not impair ristocetin induced platelet agglutination, mediated by gpib."

4606,9242201L4,9242201,there was a significant negative correlation between melatonin (r =  0.69) and testosterone concentrations.
4607,9242201L5,9242201,"these data indicate that diminished testosterone in male primary hypogonadism is associated with enhanced plasma levels of melatonin, and that testosterone substitution treatment induces a deamplification of the circadian rhythm of melatonin values in humans."

4612,8383969L2,8383969,"in a medium with 1 mmol/l extracellular calcium, thrombin (2.5 units/ml) induced an increment in [ca2+]i of 638 +/  31 nmol/l (n = 5) and an intracellular alkalinization of 0.14 +/  0.01 ph units (n = 8)."
4613,8383969L3,8383969,"both responses were dependent on the concentration of thrombin, displaying a sigmoidal dose response pattern."
4614,8383969L4,8383969,"the intracellular alkalinization was dependent upon extracellular na+ and was amiloride sensitive, indicating that it was mediated by activation of the na+/h+ exchanger."

4616,8383969L6,8383969,"under these circumstances, the [ca2+]i increment represents mobilization from internal stores, reaching 157 +/  42 nmol/l at 2.5 units/ml thrombin."
4617,8383969L7,8383969,"when platelets were preloaded with the intracellular calcium chelator maptam (1,2 bis 5 methylaminophenoxylethane nnn' tetraacetoxymethyl acetate) to block the increase in [ca2+]i induced by thrombin, no increment in phi was observed."

4619,8383969L9,8383969,"ionomycin induced an elevation of [ca2+]i that was accompanied by a concomitant increase in phi, which was na(+) dependent and amiloride sensitive."
4620,8383969L10,8383969,[ca2+]i and phi increases induced by ionomycin were both dependent on the concentration of ionomycin.
4621,8383969L11,8383969,"in conclusion, an increase in [ca2+]i is necessary for the agonist induced activation of the na+/h+ exchanger in platelets."
4622,8383969L12,8383969,non agonist induced increases in [ca2+]i seems to prompt activation of the exchanger.
4623,8383969L13,8383969,"in addition, ca(2+) depleted platelets have a more acidic basal phi, indicating that the basal level of [ca2+]i is also important for maintaining the basal phi."

4643,9479635L7,9479635,both ns 398 and indomethacin suppressed prostaglandin production and cell proliferation after growth stimulation.
4644,9479635L8,9479635,expression of cox 2 mrna was observed 40 and 60 min after administration of 0.6 n hcl.
4645,9479635L9,9479635,gastric lesions developed within 60 min after hcl administration and healed significantly within 48 h. the present study shows the expression of cox 2 in gastric epithelial cells in vitro and in gastric mucosa after injury in vivo.
4646,9479635L10,9479635,the results also suggest that cox 2 is involved in de novo synthesis of prostaglandins and cell proliferation in gastric epithelium.

4687,10523830L8,10523830,a human fli 1 derived genomic fragment containing the gata/ebs led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the sv40 promoter in the erythroleukemic hel cell line.
4688,10523830L9,10523830,"in addition, an increasing number of gata/ebs oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the ebs consensus sequence was mutated."
4689,10523830L10,10523830,one of the factors binding to the gata/ebs region was identified to be spi 1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the ebs element of the human ets 2 gene.
4690,10523830L11,10523830,supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the gata 1 factor to the gata/ebs dual element.

4756,16109736L0,16109736,steroidogenic factor 1 (sf 1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that has emerged as a critical mediator of endocrine function at multiple levels of the hypothalamic pituitary steroidogenic axis.
4757,16109736L1,16109736,"within the adrenal cortex, acth dependent transcriptional responses, including transcriptional activation of several key steroidogenic enzymes within the steroid biosynthetic pathway, are largely dependent upon sf 1 action."
4758,16109736L2,16109736,the absence of a bona fide endogenous eukaryotic ligand for sf 1 suggests that signaling pathway activation downstream of the melanocortin 2 receptor (mc2r) modulates this transcriptional response.
4759,16109736L3,16109736,we have used the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to examine the temporal formation of acth dependent transcription complexes on the mc2r gene promoter.

4775,28233777L4,28233777,"global gene expression studies suggest that rd26 can act antagonistically to br to regulate the expression of a subset of bes1 regulated genes, thereby inhibiting br function."
4776,28233777L5,28233777,we show that rd26 can interact with bes1 protein and antagonize bes1 transcriptional activity on br regulated genes and that br signalling can also repress expression of rd26 and its homologues and inhibit drought responses.
4777,28233777L6,28233777,our results thus reveal a mechanism coordinating plant growth and drought tolerance.

4958,10617676L0,10617676,the signaling pathway of protein kinase c (pkc) is known to play a role in mediating the action of various cytokines.
4959,10617676L1,10617676,here we examined the signal transduction pathway of pkc activation and the role of pkc isoforms in interleukin 1beta (il 1beta) mediated cyclooxygenase 2 (cox 2) expression in human pulmonary epithelial cell line (a549).
4960,10617676L2,10617676,"the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and tyrphostin ag126) and phosphatidylcholine phospholipase c inhibitor (d 609) prevented il 1beta induced prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) release and cox 2 expression, whereas u 73122 (a phosphatidylinositol phospholipase c inhibitor) and propranolol (a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor) had no effect."
4961,10617676L3,10617676,"the pkc inhibitors (go 6976 and ro 31 8220) and nf kappab inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, also attenuated il 1beta induced pge(2) release and cox 2 expression."
4962,10617676L4,10617676,"western blot analysis using pkc isoenzyme specific antibodies indicated that a549 cells expressed pkc alpha,  gamma,  iota,  lambda,  zeta, and  micro."
4963,10617676L5,10617676,il 1beta caused the translocation of pkc gamma but not other isoforms from cytosol to the membrane fraction.
4964,10617676L6,10617676,"moreover, the translocation of pkc gamma was inhibited by genistein or d 609, but not by u 73122. il 1beta caused the translocation of p65 nf kappab from cytosol to the nucleus as well as the degradation of ikappab alpha in cytosol."
4965,10617676L7,10617676,"furthermore, the translocation of p65 nf kappab was inhibited by genistein, go 6976, ro 31 8220, or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate."
4966,10617676L8,10617676,"these results indicate that in human pulmonary epithelial cells, il 1beta might activate phosphatidylcholine phospholipase c through an upstream tyrosine phosphorylation to elicit pkc activation, which in turn initiates nf kappab activation, and finally induces cox 2 expression and pge(2) release."
4967,10617676L9,10617676,"of the pkc isoforms present in a549 cells, only activation of pkc gamma is involved in regulating il 1beta induced responses."
4968,12914524L0,12914524,we undertook a study of molecular interference of nuclear orphan receptors.
4969,12914524L1,12914524,nuclear receptor response element 1 (nrre 1) from the human medium chain acyl coenzyme a dehydrogenase (mcad) gene promoter was shown to contain three hexamer elements (site 1 through 3) that are known to interact with a number of nuclear receptors including chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (coup tf) and estrogen related receptor alpha (erralpha).
4970,12914524L2,12914524,we demonstrated that the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha/9 cis retinoic acid receptor alpha (pparalpha/rxralpha) heterodimer complex can also bind to the two hexamer repeat sequences (between site 1 and site 3) arranged as an everted imperfect repeat separated by 14 bp (er14).
4971,12914524L3,12914524,mutations of the putative core elements have shown that these three sites are differentially involved in erralpha and pparalpha/rxralpha binding.
4972,12914524L4,12914524,homodimer of erralpha was shown to interact between site 1 and site 3 (er14).
4973,12914524L5,12914524,"to date, no nuclear receptor is known to bind to response elements over such long intervals."
4974,12914524L6,12914524,"interestingly, site 1 was shown to be essential for erralpha binding while site 3 supports its binding only in the presence of site 1. furthermore, it was shown that the binding profile of erralpha and pparalpha/rxralpha are competitive rather than making a high order complex within nrre 1. at the cellular level, transcriptional activation driven by the pparalpha/rxralpha complex was counteracted by the expression of erralpha in hela cells."
4975,12914524L7,12914524,"these results suggest that erralpha and pparalpha/rxralpha could interfere with each other's function through binding to similar dna elements, thereby finetuning the transcriptional outcome of the target gene."
4976,12914524L8,12914524,our findings suggest a mechanism whereby multiple nuclear receptors can activate or repress dna binding or transcription via a single pleiotropic regulatory element.
4977,26745078L0,26745078,we have recently shown that thymoquinone (tq) has a potent cytotoxic effect and induces apoptosis via caspase 3 activation with down regulation of xiap in mouse neuroblastoma (neuro 2a) cells.
4978,26745078L1,26745078,"interestingly, our results showed that tq was significantly more cytotoxic towards neuro 2a cells when compared with primary normal neuronal cells."
4979,26745078L2,26745078,"in this study, the effects of tq on cell cycle regulation and the mechanisms that contribute to this effect were investigated using neuro 2a cells."
4980,26745078L3,26745078,"cell cycle analysis performed by flow cytometry revealed cell cycle arrest at g2/m phase and a significant increase in the accumulation of tq treated cells at sub g1 phase, indicating induction of apoptosis by the compound."
4981,26745078L4,26745078,"moreover, tq increased the expression of p53, p21 mrna and protein levels, whereas it decreased the protein expression of pcna, cyclin b1 and cdc2 in a dose  dependent manner."
4982,26745078L5,26745078,our finding suggests that tq could suppress cell growth and cell survival via arresting the cell cycle in the g2/m phase and inducing apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells.
4983,11554472L0,11554472,there are only a few proteins identified at the cell surface that could directly regulate plant cell wall functions.
4984,11554472L1,11554472,the cell wall associated kinases (waks) of angiosperms physically link the plasma membrane to the carbohydrate matrix and are unique in that they have the potential to directly signal cellular events through their cytoplasmic kinase domain.
4985,11554472L2,11554472,"in arabidopsis there are five waks and each has a cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase domain, spans the plasma membrane, and extends a domain into the cell wall."
4986,11554472L3,11554472,"the wak extracellular domain is variable among the five isoforms, and collectively the family is expressed in most vegetative tissues."
4987,11554472L4,11554472,"wak1 and wak2 are the most ubiquitously and abundantly expressed of the five tandemly arrayed genes, and their messages are present in vegetative meristems, junctions of organ types, and areas of cell expansion."
4988,11554472L5,11554472,they are also induced by pathogen infection and wounding.
4989,11554472L6,11554472,recent experiments demonstrate that antisense wak expression leads to a reduction in wak protein levels and the loss of cell expansion.
4990,11554472L7,11554472,"a large amount of wak is covalently linked to pectin, and most wak that is bound to pectin is also phosphorylated."
4991,11554472L8,11554472,"in addition, one wak isoform binds to a secreted glycine rich protein (grp)."
4992,11554472L9,11554472,"the data support a model where wak is bound to grp as a phosphorylated kinase, and also binds to pectin."
4993,11554472L10,11554472,how waks are involved in signaling from the pectin extracellular matrix in coordination with grps will be key to our understanding of the cell wall's role in cell growth.
4994,15959848L0,15959848,assessment of reactive oxygen species (ros) is highly important in neurodegenerative disorders and neuroleptic treatment.
4995,15959848L1,15959848,"however, conflicting results have been reported, which may arise from methodological difficulties."
4996,15959848L2,15959848,obstructive sleep apnea (osa) syndrome with episodic hypoxia reoxygenation is proposed as a human model for the investigation of ros measurements.
4997,15959848L3,15959848,"despite a broad analytical approach comprising lipid peroxidation and amino acid oxidation products, oxidative dna damage, and activity of the antioxidant defense, only plasma malondialdehyde (mda) and urinary o,o' dityrosine seemed to be appropriate, robust biomarkers of oxidative stress, which are also simple enough for routine clinical use."
4998,15959848L4,15959848,"mda concentrations correlated with a duration of nocturnal desaturation below 85% (r = 0.77, p<0.0005), and o,o' dityrosine levels decreased after therapy (p<0.05) as a function of baseline concentrations (r =  0.61, p<0.05)."
4999,15959848L5,15959848,gender effects in ros generation also have to be considered.
5000,15959848L6,15959848,"at present, we recommend the application of several oxidative stress measurements at different time points, preferably involving plasma mda and urinary o,o' dityrosine."

5006,12624792L0,12624792,"protein kinase b (pkb) is an important intermediate in the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signaling cascade that acts to phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase 3 (gsk 3) at its serine 9 residue, thereby inactivating it."
5007,12624792L1,12624792,activated gsk 3 has been previously shown to be preferentially associated with neurofibrillary tangles (nfts) in alzheimer's disease (ad) brain.
5008,12624792L2,12624792,"in the present study, we performed immunohistochemistry with an antibody to the active form of pkb in brains with different stages of neurofibrillary degeneration."
5009,12624792L3,12624792,we found that the amount of activated pkb (p thr308) increased in correlation to the progressive sequence of at8 immunoreactivity and neurofibrillary changes assessed according to braak's criteria.
5010,12624792L4,12624792,"by confocal microscopy, activated pkb (p thr308) was found to appear in particular in neurons that are known to later develop nfts in ad."
5011,12624792L5,12624792,"western blotting showed that activated pkb was increased by more than 50% in the 16,000  g supernatants of ad brains as compared with normal aged and huntington's disease controls."
5012,12624792L6,12624792,this increase in pkb levels corresponded with a several fold increase in the levels of total tau and abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau at the tau 1 site.
5013,12624792L7,12624792,these studies suggest the involvement of pkb/gsk 3 signaling in alzheimer neurofibrillary degeneration.
5014,21134635L0,21134635,one of the most fundamental problems in cell biology concerns how cells communicate with their surroundings through surface receptors.
5015,21134635L1,21134635,the last few decades have seen major advances in understanding the mechanisms of receptor ligand recognition and the biochemical consequences of such encounters.
5016,21134635L2,21134635,this review describes the emergence of solution nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy as a powerful tool for the structural characterization of membrane associated protein domains involved in transmembrane signaling.
5017,21134635L3,21134635,"we highlight particularly instructive examples from the fields of immunoreceptor biology, growth hormone signaling, and cell adhesion."
5018,21134635L4,21134635,these signaling complexes comprise multiple subunits each spanning the membrane with a single helical segment that links extracellular ligand binding domains to the cell interior.
5019,21134635L5,21134635,the apparent simplicity of this domain organization belies the complexity involved in cooperative assembly of functional structures that translate information across the cellular boundary.
5020,2445557L0,2445557,we have used radiolabeled ovine insulin like growth factor ii (oigf ii) and human igf i (higf i) to investigate the nature of the igf binding proteins in fetal sheep serum.
5021,2445557L1,2445557,"incubation of fetal sheep serum with [125i]oigf ii, followed by chromatography on fractogel tsk hw55(s), revealed the presence of two major binding protein species, a lower molecular weight binding protein (apparent mol wt approximately 60,000) and a much higher molecular weight binding protein (apparent mol wt approximately 500,000)."
5022,2445557L2,2445557,only the lower molecular weight binding protein complex was seen in serum from adult nonpregnant sheep.
5023,2445557L3,2445557,"the lower molecular weight binding protein in fetal and adult sheep serum bound both [125i]oigf ii and [125i]higf i, both of which could be displaced by unlabeled oigf ii or higf i. however, the very high molecular weight binding protein bound only [125i]oigf ii, and this could only be displaced by unlabeled oigf ii."
5024,2445557L4,2445557,the very high molecular weight binding protein appears to bind approximately 40% of the endogenous oigf ii.
5025,2445557L5,2445557,"we have purified the very high molecular weight binding protein from fetal sheep serum using anion exchange, concanavalin a sepharose, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography."
5026,2445557L6,2445557,"the purified binding protein preparation did not contain any lower molecular weight binding protein and did not bind [125i]higf i. in addition, this binding protein was stable at ph 3.2 for 1 h. thus, fetal sheep serum contains a very high molecular weight igf binding glycoprotein that is acid stable and specific for igf ii."
5027,9515568L0,9515568,the protective/antioxidative properties of diaryl tellurides were demonstrated in cellular systems of increasing complexity.

5030,9515568L3,9515568,"as judged by their abilities to reduce formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances at concentrations close to 1 microm, diaryl tellurides 1a, 1d and 2b protected rat kidney tissue against oxidative damage caused by anoxia and reoxygenation."
5031,9515568L4,9515568,the organotellurium compounds also offered protection after systemic administration.
5032,9515568L5,9515568,"in the presence of diaryl telluride 2b (0.1 1 microm), the ischemia/reperfusion induced vascular permeability increase in the hamster cheek pouch was significantly reduced as compared with the control."
5033,9515568L6,9515568,some of the most active organotellurium cell protectants were evaluated for their ability to inhibit formation of the inflammatory mediators leukotriene b4 and interleukin 1beta.
5034,9515568L7,9515568,an inhibitory effect on the secretion of these species was seen for compounds 1a and 2b at or above 10 microm concentrations.
5035,9515568L8,9515568,"the protective effects of diaryl tellurides against t butyl hydroperoxide induced cell injury can be ascribed mainly to the peroxide decomposing, glutathione peroxidase like capacity of the compounds."
5036,9515568L9,9515568,"the chain breaking, electron  or hydrogen atom donating ability of diaryl tellurides seems to be the main reason for their protection against leukocyte mediated cell damage in caco 2 cells and in the oxidatively challenged rat kidney and hamster cheek pouch."
5037,20014242L0,20014242,the aim of this study was to explore potential transport mechanisms of cetirizine enantiomers across caco 2 cells.
5038,20014242L1,20014242,"cetirizine displayed polarized transport at concentrations ranging from 4.0 to 80.0 microm, with the permeability in the secretory direction being 1.4  to 4.0 fold higher than that in the absorptive direction."
5039,20014242L2,20014242,cetirizine enantiomers were transported distinctively different from each other.
5040,20014242L3,20014242,"in the presence of inhibitors of p glycoprotein (p gp) and multidrug resistance associated protein (mrp), the absorptive transport was enhanced and secretory efflux was diminished."
5041,20014242L4,20014242,"when verapamil, indomethacin, or probenecid were present, the difference in the absorptive permeability of r cetirizine and s cetirizine substantially intensified, whereas quinidine could eliminate."
5042,20014242L5,20014242,r cetirizine significantly increased the efflux ratio of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin in a fashion indicative of the upregulation of p gp and mrp activities.
5043,20014242L6,20014242,"however, s cetirizine played a role of an inhibitor for p gp and mrp."
5044,20014242L7,20014242,"ranitidine modified the absorption of cetirizine enantiomers, suggesting that the potential drug drug interaction would significantly change the cetirizine pharmacokinetics."
5045,20014242L8,20014242,"in conclusion, the results indicated that there are several efflux transporters including p gp and mrp participating the absorption and efflux of cetirizine, which showed enantioselectivity in the transmembrane process."
5046,20014242L9,20014242,"in addition, both p gp and mrp functions could be modulated by cetirizine in chiral discriminative ways."
5047,18070883L0,18070883,"sprouty (spry) proteins modulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and, thereby, regulate cell migration and proliferation."
5048,18070883L1,18070883,"here, we have examined the role of endogenous human spry2 (hspry2) in the regulation of cellular apoptosis."
5049,18070883L2,18070883,small inhibitory rna mediated silencing of hspry2 abolished the anti apoptotic action of serum in adrenal cortex adenocarcinoma (sw13) cells.
5050,18070883L3,18070883,silencing of hspry2 decreased serum  or epidermal growth factor (egf) elicited activation of akt and erk1/2 and reduced the levels of egf receptor.
5051,18070883L4,18070883,silencing of hspry2 also inhibited serum induced activation of p90rsk and decreased phosphorylation of pro apoptotic protein bad (bcl2 antagonist of cell death) by p90rsk.
5052,18070883L5,18070883,"inhibiting both the erk1/2 and akt pathways abolished the ability of serum to protect against apoptosis, mimicking the effects of silencing hspry2."
5053,18070883L6,18070883,"serum transactivated the egf receptor (egfr), and inhibition of the egfr by a neutralizing antibody attenuated the anti apoptotic actions of serum."
5054,18070883L7,18070883,"consistent with the role of egfr and perhaps other growth factor receptors in the anti apoptotic actions of serum, the tyrosine kinase binding domain of c cbl (cbl tkb) protected against down regulation of the growth factor receptors such as egfr and preserved the anti apoptotic actions of serum when hspry2 was silenced."
5055,18070883L8,18070883,"additionally, silencing of spry2 in c cbl null cells did not alter the ability of serum to promote cell survival."
5056,18070883L9,18070883,"moreover, reintroduction of wild type hspry2, but not its mutants that do not bind c cbl or cin85 into sw13 cells after endogenous hspry2 had been silenced, restored the anti apoptotic actions of serum."
5057,18070883L10,18070883,"overall, we conclude that endogenous hspry2 mediated regulation of apoptosis requires c cbl and is manifested by the ability of hspry2 to sequester c cbl and thereby augment signaling via growth factor receptors."
5058,25081999L0,25081999,rna polymerase ii carboxyl terminal domain (rnapii ctd) phosphatases are responsible for the dephosphorylation of the c terminal domain of the small subunit of rnapii in eukaryotes.

5062,25081999L4,25081999,"to gain insight into the ptm of hscp1, we used the western blot, immunoprecipitation, succinylayed wheat germ agglutininprecipitation, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analyses, and site directed mutagenesis and identified the ser41 residue of hscp1 as the o glcnac modification site."
5063,25081999L5,25081999,"these results suggest that hscp1 may be an o glcnacylated protein in vivo, and its n terminus may function a possible role in the ptm, providing a scaffold for binding the protein(s)."

5141,16669706L2,16669706,the clonogenic cell death caused by the combination of radiation and beta lap was synergistic when beta lap was administered 0 10 h after irradiation but not when it was given before irradiation.
5142,16669706L3,16669706,"the expression and activity of nqo1 increased significantly and remained elevated for longer than 12 h after 4 gy irradiation, suggesting that the long lasting elevation of nqo1 sensitized the cells to beta lap."
5143,16669706L4,16669706,studies with split dose irradiation demonstrated that beta lap given immediately after irradiation effectively inhibited sublethal radiation damage (sld) repair.
5144,16669706L5,16669706,"taken together, these results lead us to conclude that the synergistic interaction between beta lap and radiation in killing cells is the result of two distinct mechanisms: first, radiation sensitizes cells to beta lap by up regulating nqo1, and second, beta lap sensitizes cells to radiation by inhibiting sld repair."
5145,16669706L6,16669706,the combination of beta lap and radiotherapy is potentially promising modality for the treatment of cancer in humans.

5152,22982511L6,22982511,ly30 treatment caused a rapid increase of ros (measured by dcfda) as well as a significant increase in rns and calcium.
5153,22982511L7,22982511,"bayesian modelling predicted that ca(2+)was a partial cause of the ros induced by short incubations with ly30, and that rns was strongly responsible for the ros induced by long incubations with ly30."
5154,22982511L8,22982511,"validation experiments confirmed the predicted roles of rns and calcium, and also demonstrated a causal role for o(2)( )."

5165,23783031L0,23783031,condensins are multisubunit complexes that play central roles in chromosome organization and segregation in eukaryotes.
5166,23783031L1,23783031,"many eukaryotic species have two different condensin complexes (condensins i and ii), although some species, such as fungi, have condensin i only."
5167,23783031L2,23783031,here we use the red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae as a model organism because it represents the smallest and simplest organism that is predicted to possess both condensins i and ii.
5168,23783031L3,23783031,"we demonstrate that, despite the great evolutionary distance, spatiotemporal dynamics of condensins in c. merolae is strikingly similar to that observed in mammalian cells: condensin ii is nuclear throughout the cell cycle, whereas condensin i appears on chromosomes only after the nuclear envelope partially dissolves at prometaphase."
5169,23783031L4,23783031,"unlike in mammalian cells, however, condensin ii is confined to centromeres in metaphase, whereas condensin i distributes more broadly along arms."
5170,23783031L5,23783031,"we firmly establish a targeted gene disruption technique in this organism and find, to our surprise, that condensin ii is not essential for mitosis under laboratory growth conditions, although it plays a crucial role in facilitating sister centromere resolution in the presence of a microtubule drug."

5173,6704420L1,6704420,observation of inhibition was dependent upon the mode of addition of the substrate and inhibitor suggesting segregation of the compounds into different microsomal vesicles under certain conditions.
5174,6704420L2,6704420,the result is consistent with reduction of both vitamin k quinone and vitamin k epoxide by a single enzyme or a multisite enzyme complex.

5179,16392245L4,16392245,"it is suggested that the elevated activities of dao and pao may be responsible, in part, for the antifungal effects of the basil oil, possibly via the generation of hydrogen peroxide and the subsequent triggering of programmed cell death."
5180,22147953L0,22147953,"in the past, segments were defined by landmarks such as muscle attachments, notably by snodgrass, the king of insect anatomists."
5181,22147953L1,22147953,"here, we show how an objective definition of a segment, based on developmental compartments, can help explain the dorsal abdomen of adult drosophila."
5182,22147953L2,22147953,"the anterior (a) compartment of each segment is subdivided into two domains of cells, each responding differently to hedgehog."
5183,22147953L3,22147953,the anterior of these domains is non neurogenic and clones lacking notch develop normally; this domain can express stripe and form muscle attachments.
5184,22147953L4,22147953,the posterior domain is neurogenic and clones lacking notch do not form cuticle; this domain is unable to express stripe or form muscle attachments.
5185,22147953L5,22147953,the posterior (p) compartment does not form muscle attachments.
5186,22147953L6,22147953,our in vivo films indicate that early in the pupa the anterior domain of the a compartment expresses stripe in a narrowing zone that attracts the extending myotubes and resolves into the attachment sites for the dorsal abdominal muscles.
5187,22147953L7,22147953,"we map the tendon cells precisely and show that all are confined to the anterior domain of a. it follows that the dorsal abdominal muscles are intersegmental, spanning from one anterior domain to the next."
5188,22147953L8,22147953,this view is tested and supported by clones that change cell identity or express stripe ectopically.
5189,22147953L9,22147953,it seems that growing myotubes originate in posterior a and extend forwards and backwards until they encounter and attach to anterior a cells.
5190,22147953L10,22147953,the dorsal adult muscles are polarised in the anteroposterior axis: we disprove the hypothesis that muscle orientation depends on genes that define planar cell polarity in the epidermis.

5193,15476271L2,15476271,amplification of the cyclin d1 gene (ccnd1) was detected in a small number of mgctos (5 of 42 tumours: 13.5%).
5194,15476271L3,15476271,reduced expression of p16 due to promoter methylation correlated significantly with increased cell proliferation as evidenced by ki 67 labelling index (p < 0.001) and mitotic index (p < 0.01).
5195,15476271L4,15476271,"in some tumour types, nuclear localization of beta catenin has been reported to be associated with beta catenin gene (ctnnb1) mutation, cyclin d1 overexpression, and increased cell proliferation."
5196,15476271L5,15476271,"nuclear localization of beta catenin, which was observed in mgctos other than dysgerminoma, was not associated with cyclin d1 expression and increased cell proliferation, but appeared to be related to tumour differentiation."
5197,15476271L6,15476271,"furthermore, ctnnb1 mutations were not detected in any of the mgctos examined."
5198,15476271L7,15476271,our results suggest that reduced expression of p16 due to ink4a promoter methylation is one of the principal factors that promote cell proliferation in mgctos.

5201,24583701L1,24583701,"24 male, sprague dawley rats were divided into 3 groups; (a) control group: abdomen was directly closed after reached aorta, and followed by 72 hours, (b) short term ischaemia reperfusion group: peripheral nerve ischemia was induced in rats by supraceliac aortic occlusion for 20 min followed by 72 h of reperfusion, (c) long term ischaemia reperfusion group: peripheral nerve ischemia was induced for 30 min followed by 72 h of reperfusion."
5202,24583701L2,24583701,"preoperative and postoperative, electromyography (emg) recordings were done."
5203,24583701L3,24583701,"end of 72 h, the sciatic nerves were harvested from each animal for histopathological and biochemical analysis."
5204,24583701L4,24583701,the mean compound muscle action potential (cmap) amplitude of long term ischaemia reperfusion group was statically significant reduced when compared to the control group (p <0.01).
5205,24583701L5,24583701,"however, the mean distal latency value of long term ischaemia reperfusion group was statically significant increased (p <0.01)."
5206,24583701L6,24583701,"on the other hand, there were statically significant differences between the results of malondialdehyde, edema and ischemia fiber degeneration grades on control and long term ischaemia reperfusion group (p <0.001)."
5207,24583701L7,24583701,this study demonstrated that the extending cross clamping time directly harms the peripheral nerve of rats.
5208,3026233L0,3026233,this study investigates the effects of both adriamycin and its 13 hydroxylated metabolite adriamycinol on superoxide anion production from cardiac sarcosomes and by mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase.
5209,3026233L1,3026233,superoxide anion production was determined by using the succinoylated cytochrome c reduction assay.
5210,3026233L2,3026233,both adriamycin and adriamycinol stimulated superoxide formation in cardiac sarcosomes and by mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase.
5211,3026233L3,3026233,in the first case only nadph was required as a co factor and in the second case only nadh.
5212,3026233L4,3026233,"from sarcosomes as well as by nadh dehydrogenase, the superoxide production followed michaelis menten kinetics."
5213,3026233L5,3026233,"with both activating enzymatic systems, the vmax of adriamycinol was found to be similar to that of adriamycin, but the km for the former anthracycline was higher than for the latter."
5214,3026233L6,3026233,"adriamycinol also increased the rate of nadph and nadh consumption, by sarcosomal fractions and by nadh dehydrogenase respectively."
5215,3026233L7,3026233,"at equimolar consentrations, adriamycinol consumed less nadph and nadh than adriamycin."
5216,3026233L8,3026233,these results suggest that adriamycinol could contribute to the chronic cardiac toxicity of adriamycin by forming superoxide anions in cardiac cells constituents.
5217,27983594L0,27983594,stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous tooth (shed) offer several advantages over other stem cell sources.
5218,27983594L1,27983594,"using shed, we examined the roles of zinc and the zinc uptake transporter zip8 (zrt  and irt like protein 8) while inducing shed into insulin secreting β cell like stem cells (i.e., shed β cells)."
5219,27983594L2,27983594,"we observed that zip8 expression increased as shed differentiated into shed β cells, and that zinc supplementation at day 10 increased the levels of most pancreatic β cell markers particularly insulin and glucose transporter 2 (glut2)."
5220,27983594L3,27983594,we confirmed that shed β cells produce insulin successfully.
5221,27983594L4,27983594,"in addition, we note that zinc supplementation significantly increases insulin secretion with a significant elevation of zip8 transporters in shed β cells."
5222,27983594L5,27983594,we conclude that shed can be converted into insulin secreting β cell like cells as zinc concentration in the cytosol is elevated.
5223,27983594L6,27983594,insulin production by shed β cells can be regulated via modulation of zinc concentration in the media as zip8 expression in the shed β cells increases.
5224,25261857L0,25261857,"large amounts of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), benzene and toluene (bt) might be emitted from incomplete combustion reactions in both coal tar factories and biomass fuels in rural china."
5225,25261857L1,25261857,the health effects arising from exposure to pahs and bt are a concern for residents of rural areas close to coal tar plants.
5226,25261857L2,25261857,"to assess the environmental risk and major exposure sources, 100 coke plant workers and 25 farmers in qujing, china were recruited."

5228,25261857L4,25261857,the 8 ohdg levels in the urine were determined to evaluate the oxidative dna damage induced by the pahs and bt.
5229,25261857L5,25261857,"the results showed that the levels of the oh pahs, particularly those of 1 hydroxynathalene and 1 hydroxypyrene, in the farmers were 1 7 times higher than those in the workers."
5230,25261857L6,25261857,the concentrations of the bt metabolites were comparable between the workers and farmers.
5231,25261857L7,25261857,"although the exact work location within a coke oven plant might affect the levels of the oh pahs, one way anova revealed no significant differences for either the oh pahs levels or the bt concentrations among the three groups working at different work sites."
5232,25261857L8,25261857,the geometric mean concentration (9.17 µg/g creatinine) of 8 ohdg was significantly higher in the farmers than in the plant workers (6.27 µg/g creatinine).
5233,25261857L9,25261857,the levels of 8 ohdg did not correlate with the total concentrations of oh pahs and the total levels of bt metabolites.
5234,25261857L10,25261857,"incompletely combusted biomass fuels might be the major exposure source, contributing more pahs and bt to the local residents of qujing."
5235,25261857L11,25261857,"the estimated daily intakes (edis) of naphthalene and fluorene for all of the workers and most of the farmers were below the reference doses (rfds) recommended by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa), except for the pyrene levels in two farmers."
5236,25261857L12,25261857,"however, the edis of benzene in the workers and local farmers ranged from 590 to 7239 µg/day, and these levels were 2  to 30 fold higher than the rfds recommended by the epa."
5237,25261857L13,25261857,biomass fuel combustion and industrial activities related to coal tar were the major sources of the pah and bt exposure in the local residents.
5238,25261857L14,25261857,using biomass fuels for household cooking and heating explains the higher exposure levels observed in the farmers relative to the workers at the nearby coal tar related industrial facility.
5239,16029205L0,16029205,it is well established that light pulses regulate components of the extracellular signal regulated kinases i/ii (erk) cascade in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (scn) circadian clock.
5240,16029205L1,16029205,these events are important for photic resetting of the circadian clock.
5241,16029205L2,16029205,"the scn circadian clock is also reset by pulses of dark, but it is unknown if this stimulus alters the activity of erk, the transcription factor elk 1 or expression of the immediate early gene c fos in the scn."
5242,16029205L3,16029205,"using syrian hamsters free running in constant light, we determined the effects of dark pulses on these factors in the scn."
5243,16029205L4,16029205,"in constant light, levels of phosphorylated erk (p erk) showed significant circadian variation in the syrian hamster scn, while levels of c fos or phosphorylated elk 1 (p elk 1) did not."
5244,16029205L5,16029205,"a 6 h dark pulse beginning at circadian time (ct) 8 down regulated expression of p erk and c fos, but not p elk 1, in the scn."
5245,16029205L6,16029205,"following termination of the pulse, levels of c fos increased above time matched control values, while p erk expression did not."
5246,16029205L7,16029205,"when given at the beginning of the subjective night (ct13), a 6 h dark pulse did not phase shift behavioural rhythms and failed to alter the expression of c fos, p erk, or p elk 1 in the scn."
5247,16029205L8,16029205,"at the level of the visual thalamus, expression of c fos in the intergeniculate leaflet was higher during the subjective night as compared to the subjective day, although dark pulses had no robust effects on expression of c fos or p elk 1 in this structure."
5248,16029205L9,16029205,we conclude that dark pulse resetting of the circadian clock is complex and involves both non photic and photic components.

5250,23604316L1,23604316,malfunction of the mechanisms that ensure this coordination underlie metabolic diseases in humans.
5251,23604316L2,23604316,"in mammals, lysosomal and autophagic function is required for normal fat storage and mobilization in the presence or absence of food."
5252,23604316L3,23604316,autophagy is tightly linked to nutrients.
5253,23604316L4,23604316,"however, if and how lysosomal lipolysis is coupled to nutritional status remains to be determined."
5254,23604316L5,23604316,here we identify mxl 3 and hlh 30 (tfeb orthologue) [corrected] as transcriptional switches coupling lysosomal lipolysis and autophagy to nutrient availability and controlling fat storage and ageing in caenorhabditis elegans.
5255,23604316L6,23604316,transcriptional coupling of lysosomal lipolysis and autophagy to nutrients is also observed in mammals.
5256,23604316L7,23604316,"thus, mxl 3 and hlh 30 orchestrate an adaptive and conserved cellular response to nutritional status and regulate lifespan."
5257,20371185L0,20371185,oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson's and alzheimer's diseases.
5258,20371185L1,20371185,natural kavalactones isolated from piper methysticum (piperaceae) are capable of activating the nrf2/are (antioxidant response element) pathway and thus enhancing the expression of phase ii antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1 (ho 1).
5259,20371185L2,20371185,"in an attempt to identify kavalactone derivatives that are more potent in nrf2/are activation than natural compounds, we synthesized a series of chemically modified kavalactones and studied their effects on the are enhancer activity in rat pheochromocytoma pc12 cells."
5260,20371185L3,20371185,"among 81 compounds tested, a kavalactone derivative, 2',6' dichloro 5 methoxymethyl 5,6 dehydrokawain [(e) 6 (2',6' dichlorostyryl) 4 methoxy 5 (methoxymethyl) 2h pyran 2 one] (1), exhibited the strongest are enhancer activity."
5261,20371185L4,20371185,the are activation and ho 1 protein induction by the compound 1 were higher than those by natural kavalactones.
5262,20371185L5,20371185,the compound did not affect cell viability and induced expression of various phase ii enzymes.
5263,20371185L6,20371185,nuclear translocation of nrf2 after treatment with 1 was preceded by phosphorylation of erk1/2 and p38.
5264,20371185L7,20371185,the compound transiently increased intracellular ros levels.
5265,20371185L8,20371185,"finally, pretreatment with the compound ameliorated h(2)o(2) induced cell death, which was associated with increased expression of ho 1. these results suggest that the compound 1 protects against oxidative stress induced neuronal cell death via a preconditioning effect on the nrf2/are activation."
5266,11532923L0,11532923,hoxa1 and hoxb1 have overlapping synergistic roles in patterning the hindbrain and cranial neural crest cells.
5267,11532923L1,11532923,"the combination of an ectoderm specific regulatory mutation in the hoxb1 locus and the hoxa1 mutant genetic background results in an ectoderm specific double mutation, leaving the other germ layers impaired only in hoxa1 function."
5268,11532923L2,11532923,this has allowed us to examine neural crest and arch patterning defects that originate exclusively from the neuroepithelium as a result of the simultaneous loss of hoxa1 and hoxb1 in this tissue.
5269,11532923L3,11532923,"using molecular and lineage analysis in this double mutant background we demonstrate that presumptive rhombomere 4, the major site of origin of the second pharyngeal arch neural crest, is reduced in size and has lost the ability to generate neural crest cells."
5270,11532923L4,11532923,"grafting experiments using wild type cells in cultured normal or double mutant mouse embryos demonstrate that this is a cell autonomous defect, suggesting that the formation or generation of cranial neural crest has been uncoupled from segmental identity in these mutants."
5271,11532923L5,11532923,"furthermore, we show that loss of the second arch neural crest population does not have any adverse consequences on early patterning of the second arch."
5272,11532923L6,11532923,signalling molecules are expressed correctly and pharyngeal pouch and epibranchial placode formation are unaffected.
5273,11532923L7,11532923,"there are no signs of excessive cell death or loss of proliferation in the epithelium of the second arch, suggesting that the neural crest cells are not the source of any indispensable mitogenic or survival signals."
5274,11532923L8,11532923,these results illustrate that hox genes are not only necessary for proper axial specification of the neural crest but that they also play a vital role in the generation of this population itself.
5275,11532923L9,11532923,"furthermore, they demonstrate that early patterning of the separate components of the pharyngeal arches can proceed independently of neural crest cell migration."
5276,24696236L0,24696236,inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of hepatic ischemia reperfusion (i/r) injury.
5277,24696236L1,24696236,"however, the mechanism by which hepatic i/r induces inflammatory responses remains unclear."
5278,24696236L2,24696236,recent evidence indicates that a sterile inflammatory response triggered by i/r is mediated through a multiple protein complex called the inflammasome.
5279,24696236L3,24696236,"therefore, we investigated the role of the inflammasome in hepatic i/r injury and found that hepatic i/r stimuli upregulated the inflammasome component molecule, nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor (nlr) family pyrin domain containing 3 (nlrp3), but not apoptosis associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (asc)."
5280,24696236L4,24696236,"nlrp3( / ) mice, but not asc( / ) and caspase 1( / ) mice, had significantly less liver injury after hepatic i/r."
5281,24696236L5,24696236,"nlrp3( / ) mice showed reduced inflammatory responses, reactive oxygen species production, and apoptosis in i/r liver."
5282,24696236L6,24696236,"notably, infiltration of neutrophils, but not macrophages, was markedly inhibited in the i/r liver of nlrp3( / ) mice."
5283,24696236L7,24696236,"bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that nlrp3 not only in bone marrow derived cells, but also in non bone marrow derived cells contributed to liver injury after i/r."
5284,24696236L8,24696236,in vitro experiments revealed that keratinocyte derived chemokine induced activation of heterotrimeric g proteins was markedly diminished.
5285,24696236L9,24696236,"furthermore, nlrp3( / ) neutrophils decreased keratinocyte derived chemokine induced concentrations of intracellular calcium elevation, rac activation, and actin assembly formation, thereby resulting in impaired migration activity."
5286,24696236L10,24696236,"taken together, nlrp3 regulates chemokine mediated functions and recruitment of neutrophils, and thereby contributes to hepatic i/r injury independently of inflammasomes."
5287,24696236L11,24696236,these findings identify a novel role of nlrp3 in the pathophysiology of hepatic i/r injury.
5288,27812111L0,27812111,"morin (2´,3, 4´,5,7 pentahydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid with several beneficial health effects."
5289,27812111L1,27812111,"however, its poor water solubility and it sensitivity to several environmental factors avoid its use in applications like pharmaceutical and cosmetic."
5290,27812111L2,27812111,"in this work, we synthetized morin modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (amsnps mor) as useful material to be used as potential nanoantioxidant."
5291,27812111L3,27812111,"to achieve this, we characterized its adsorption kinetics, isotherm and the antioxidant capacity as hydroxyl radical (ho•) scavenger and singlet oxygen (1o2) quencher."
5292,27812111L4,27812111,"the experimental data could be well fitted with langmuir, freundlich and temkin isotherm models, besides the pseudo second order kinetics model."
5293,27812111L5,27812111,the total quenching rate constant obtained for singlet oxygen deactivation by amsnps mor was one order of magnitude lower than the morin rate constant reported previously in neat solvents and lipid membranes.
5294,27812111L6,27812111,the amsnps mor have good antioxidant properties by itself and exhibit a synergic effect with morin on the antioxidant property against hydroxyl radical.
5295,27812111L7,27812111,"this effect, in the range of concentrations studied, was increased when the amount of morin adsorbed increased."
5296,3124110L0,3124110,protein tyrosine phosphorylation in purified synaptic vesicles from rat forebrain has been studied in the presence of mn2+ and orthovanadate.
5297,3124110L1,3124110,high levels of endogenous protein tyrosine phosphorylation were observed.
5298,3124110L2,3124110,"four major phosphoproteins, with apparent molecular masses of 105, 94, 38, and 30 kda, were shown to contain phosphotyrosine."
5299,3124110L3,3124110,"the 38 kda phosphoprotein was identified as synaptophysin (p38), a well characterized integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles."
5300,3124110L4,3124110,the three other phosphotyrosine containing proteins distributed in the same manner as synaptophysin in all subcellular fractions.
5301,3124110L5,3124110,"like synaptophysin, the two high molecular weight phosphotyrosine proteins (105 and 94 kda) were found to be glycoproteins by lectin chromatography."
5302,3124110L6,3124110,tyrosine phosphorylation of synaptophysin was an intravesicular reaction and reached 50% of maximal level within 3 min.
5303,3124110L7,3124110,"triton x 100, a nonionic detergent, inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous protein substrates but not the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate, poly(glu80, tyr20)."
5304,3124110L8,3124110,"tyrosine phosphorylation of synaptophysin was also demonstrated in synaptosomes, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of synaptic vesicle proteins occurs in intact nerve terminals."
5305,7949308L0,7949308,the present study tested the hypothesis that acute melatonin treatment affects the biological clock mechanism controlling the circadian melatonin rhythm.
5306,7949308L1,7949308,adult djungarian hamsters were raised in ld 16:8 (lights on from 0300 to 1900 hr).
5307,7949308L2,7949308,"pineal and serum melatonin concentrations were assessed at specific clock times during the subsequent ld cycle (day 1) and afterwards in hamsters that remained in constant darkness (day 2), to assess the effects of treatment on the circadian melatonin rhythm."
5308,7949308L3,7949308,"in untreated controls (n = 76), melatonin increased in the pineal and in circulation within the first hour after lights off (day 1) or subjective night (day 2); melatonin concentrations remained elevated for up to 7 hr."
5309,7949308L4,7949308,"a single melatonin injection (5 micrograms/0.2 ml saline, s.c.), administered in the morning (0900 hr, n = 80) or late afternoon (1600 hr, n = 74), transiently increased in circulation but not in the pineal gland."
5310,7949308L5,7949308,"in constant darkness (day 2), the circadian melatonin rhythm in both the pineal gland and circulation was the same as that in untreated controls."
5311,7949308L6,7949308,"no significant differences were found among the three groups in the mean concentration during the day or night; the rise, fall, peak time, peak amplitude, and duration of increased melatonin were also unchanged."
5312,7949308L7,7949308,the ability of melatonin to override the effect of a light pulse on the circadian melatonin rhythm was also tested.
5313,7949308L8,7949308,"the 5 min light pulse at night (2300 2305 hr of day 1, n = 64) delayed the rise and shortened the duration of increased melatonin in both pineal gland and serum by as much as 3 hr (day 2); these light effects were more pronounced on the pineal than on the serum melatonin rhythm."
5314,7949308L9,7949308,"injection with melatonin prior to the light pulse (5 micrograms/0.2 ml saline at 2245 hr, n = 64) failed to alter the inhibitory effects of light on the circadian melatonin rhythm."
5315,7949308L10,7949308,"these data suggest that the biological clock mechanism controlling the circadian melatonin rhythm in the djungarian hamster in long days is responsive to the phase shifting effects of light, but resistant to the influence of acute melatonin treatment."

5317,9853914L1,9853914,"in the pulmonary circulation, cgmp is inactivated by specific phosphodiesterases (pde5)."
5318,9853914L2,9853914,"dipyridamole, a clinically approved drug, has inhibitory activity against pde5 and has been reported to augment the response to inhaled no in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (pphn)."
5319,9853914L3,9853914,"we wished to determine whether dipyridamole alone, or in combination with no, can be used to treat a newborn lamb model of pphn."
5320,9853914L4,9853914,"in newborn lambs with pphn, dipyridamole infused at 0.02 mg/kg/min for 45 min alone, or in combination with 5 ppm of inhaled no for the final 15 min, significantly decreased pulmonary and systemic blood pressure, decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased pulmonary blood flow."
5321,9853914L5,9853914,there was no significant difference between the pulmonary vascular effects of 5 ppm no alone compared with the effects of no combined with dipyridamole.
5322,9853914L6,9853914,"in control lambs, the 45 min infusion of dipyridamole did not change pulmonary pressure whereas systemic pressure decreased by 28 +/  3%."
5323,9853914L7,9853914,these systemic effects in control lambs persisted 90 min after discontinuing the dipyridamole infusion.
5324,9853914L8,9853914,systemic arteries isolated from both control and pphn lambs were significantly more sensitive to dipyridamole than pulmonary arteries.
5325,9853914L9,9853914,we conclude that dipyridamole has significant hemodynamic effects in both the pulmonary and systemic circulations of newborn lambs with pulmonary hypertension as well as in the systemic circulation of newborn control lambs.
5326,9853914L10,9853914,the pronounced effects of dipyridamole on the systemic circulation limits its utility as an adjunct to inhaled no in the treatment of pphn.

5332,8547579L5,8547579,the specific pattern of gene expression we have observed should help to clarify the relationships between the plc beta 4 and various constituents of second messenger systems involved in transduction mechanisms triggered by the stimulation of seven transmembrane domain receptors.

5335,17295515L1,17295515,the cardiovascular protective effects of gse are believed to be ascribed to its antioxidative properties.
5336,17295515L2,17295515,a series of studies have demonstrated that polyphenols are instrumental for the antioxidative properties of gse.
5337,17295515L3,17295515,"this study was undertaken to investigate whether two major polyphenols isolated from gse (catechin and proanthocyanidin b4) could increase the endogenous antioxidant enzymes in cardiomyocytes, and whether such increased cellular defenses could provide protection against oxidative cardiac cell injury."
5338,17295515L4,17295515,incubation of cardiac h9c2 cells with micromolar concentrations of catechin or proanthocyanidin b4 resulted in a significant induction of cellular antioxidant enzymes in a concentration dependent fashion.
5339,17295515L5,17295515,"furthermore, catechine or proanthocyanidin b4 pretreatment led to a marked reduction in xanthine oxidase (xo)/xanthine induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) accumulation and cardiac cell apoptosis."
5340,17295515L6,17295515,these results indicated that grape seed polyphenols (gsp) could protect against cardiac cell apoptosis via the induction of endogenous antioxidant enzymes.
5341,17295515L7,17295515,this may be an important mechanism underlying the protective effects of gse observed with various forms of cardiovascular disorders.
5342,26749265L0,26749265,"lung cancer is a deadly disease that can roughly be classified into three histopathological groups: lung adenocarcinomas, lung squamous cell carcinomas (lsccs), and small cell carcinomas."

5350,17363167L1,17363167,"neurofilament heavy chain (nfh) is a neuron specific protein for the neuro axonal compartment that has been proposed as a marker for axonal injury, degeneration and loss and its clinical use as a biomarker has been suggested in several neurodegenerative diseases."
5351,17363167L2,17363167,"we used an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay to quantify nfh levels in plasma in control subjects, premanifest hd mutation carriers and subjects with early and moderate manifest hd."
5352,17363167L3,17363167,"we found no correlation between plasma nfh level and disease stage, or calculated parameters based on cag repeat length, the major determinant of disease course in hd, and no evidence that nfh may be a predictor of disease onset."

5461,19402412L5,19402412,a comparison between the results we obtained here and the results we obtained previously for di tert butyl peroxide and acetylene showed that the potential reactivity of ems on ozone formation was at a relatively low level.
5462,7677759L0,7677759,mutant genes were constructed which coded for the precursor form of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase in which residue cysteine 166 was mutated to either serine or alanine and for forms of the protein lacking both the presequence and residues 1 9 of the mature protein but carrying the same cysteine mutations.
5463,7677759L1,7677759,the protein products of all of these mutant genes were imported into mitochondria that had been added to the expression system but with varying degrees of efficiency.
5464,7677759L2,7677759,"the results showed that the effects of mutation of cysteine 166 and of deletion of residues 1 9 of the mature protein on sequestration into mitochondria were essentially cumulative, suggesting that these parts of the protein are involved in distinct steps on the recognition/uptake pathway."

5466,16849566L1,16849566,"it is known that the transcriptional activation of genes, such as mdr1 and mrp1, which play a major role in the development of a multidrug resistant phenotype in tumor cells, involves the y box protein yb 1. thus, yb 1 is a promising target for new therapeutic approaches to defeat multidrug resistance."
5467,16849566L2,16849566,"in addition, it has been reported previously that yb 1 is an important factor in adenoviral replication because it activates transcription from the adenoviral e2 late promoter."

5469,16849566L4,16849566,"moreover, we show that xvir03 down regulates the expression of mdr1 and mrp1, indicating that recruiting yb 1 to the adenoviral e2 late promoter for viral replication is responsible for this effect."
5470,16849566L5,16849566,"thus, nuclear translocation of yb 1 by xvir03 leads to resensitization of tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs."
5471,16849566L6,16849566,these data reveal a link between chemotherapy and virotherapy based on the cellular transcription factor yb 1 and provide the basis for formulating a model for a novel combined therapy regimen named mutually synergistic therapy.

5474,11264013L2,11264013,here we show that pc2 is a ca(2+) permeable cation channel with properties distinct from any known intracellular channels.
5475,11264013L3,11264013,its kinetic behavior is characterized by frequent transitions between closed and open states over a wide voltage range.
5476,11264013L4,11264013,the activity of the pc2 channel is transiently increased by elevating cytosolic ca(2+).
5477,11264013L5,11264013,"given the predominant endoplasmic reticulum (er) location of pc2 and its unresponsiveness to the known modulators of mediating ca(2+) release from the er, inositol trisphosphate (ip(3)) and ryanodine, these results suggest that pc2 represents a novel type of channel with properties distinct from those of the other ca(2+) release channels."
5478,11264013L6,11264013,"our data also show that the pc2 channel can be translocated to the plasma membranes by defined chemical chaperones and proteasome modulators, suggesting that in vivo, it may also function in the plasma membrane under specific conditions."
5479,11264013L7,11264013,the sensitivity of the pc2 channel to changes of intracellular ca(2+) concentration is deficient in a mutant found in adpkd patients.
5480,11264013L8,11264013,the dysfunction of such mutants may result in defective coupling of pc2 to intracellular ca(2+) homeostasis associated with the pathogenesis of adpkd.

5485,9245802L4,9245802,secondary structure predictions for mtre indicated a largely hydrophilic protein with a single alpha helical transmembrane region.
5486,9245802L5,9245802,"a transposon like element, similar to that found downstream of the region containing the promoters for mtrr and mtrc in neisseria meningitidis, was identified 63 bp downstream of the mtre gene."

5495,9546430L2,9546430,we have determined that e2f 3 dna binding activity is restricted to the g1/s transition and s phase in both normal balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts and in an sv40 virus transformed balb/c 3t3 derivative.
5496,9546430L3,9546430,immunoblot analysis indicates that g0 and g1 cells have little or no e2f 3 polypeptide and that the increase in the dna binding activity of e2f 3 at the g1/s boundary is reflected by an increase in total e2f 3 protein.
5497,9546430L4,9546430,"in contrast to the e2f 3 polypeptide, rnase protection assays demonstrate that the e2f 3 mrna is clearly present in g0 and g1 cells."

5499,9546430L6,9546430,"together, these results indicate that the accumulation e2f 3 at s phase may be regulated, at least in part, at the level of protein stability."
5500,25658035L0,25658035,the cell is able to regulate which genes to express via chemical marks on the dna and on the histone proteins.
5501,25658035L1,25658035,"in all vertebrates, the modification on the dna is methylation at position 5 of the two cytosines present in the dinucleotide sequence cpg."
5502,25658035L2,25658035,the information encoded by these chemical marks on the dna is processed by a family of protein factors containing a conserved methyl cpg binding domain (mbd).
5503,25658035L3,25658035,"essential to their function, the mbd proteins are able to bind dna containing dimethylated cpg sites, whereas binding to unmethylated sites is not observed."
5504,25658035L4,25658035,"in this paper, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanism by which the mcpg binding domain of mbd1 is able to bind specifically dimethylated cpg sites."
5505,25658035L5,25658035,we find that the binding affinity of mbd1 to a dna containing dimethylated cpg site is stronger by 26.4 kj/mol relative to binding the same dna but with an unmethylated cpg site.
5506,25658035L6,25658035,the contribution of each of the methyl groups to the change in free energy is very similar and additive.
5507,25658035L7,25658035,"therefore, this binding affinity (to a dimethylated dna) is halved when considered relative to binding a hemimethylated dna, a result that is also supported by experimental observations."
5508,25658035L8,25658035,"despite their equal contributions, the two methyl groups are recognized differently by mbd1."
5509,25658035L9,25658035,"in one case, demethylation induces conformational changes in which the hydrophobic patch formed by the conserved residues val20, arg22, and tyr34 moves away from the (methyl)cytosine, weakening the dna protein interactions."
5510,25658035L10,25658035,this is accompanied by an intrusion of a bulk water into the binding site at the protein dna interface.
5511,25658035L11,25658035,"as a consequence, there is a reduction and rearrangements of the protein dna hydrogen bonds including a loss of a crucial hydrogen bond between tyr34 and the (methyl)cytosine."
5512,25658035L12,25658035,"the methylcytosine on the opposite strand is recognized by conformational changes of the surrounding conserved hydrophobic residues, arg44 and ser45, in which arg44 participate in the 5mc arg g triad."
5513,25658035L13,25658035,"more specifically, the hydrogens of the methyl group form weak hydrogen bonds with the guanidino group and backbone carbonyl of the conserved arg44, interactions that are absent when the cytosine is unmethylated."
5514,25658035L14,25658035,the results presented in this paper contribute to our knowledge of the different ways the chemical mark on the dna is recognized by the epigenetic machinery.

5518,19959502L3,19959502,"we first examined the expression of arkadia in 20 cancer cell lines and 2 non cancerous cell lines, and found that it was expressed ubiquitously at both the mrna and protein levels."
5519,19959502L4,19959502,"interestingly, levels of expression of c ski protein, one of the substrates of arkadia, were not correlated with those of c ski mrna."
5520,19959502L5,19959502,"arkadia induced down regulation of c ski protein expression in many cell lines examined, but did not in certain cell lines with high levels of expression of c ski protein."
5521,19959502L6,19959502,"we also found that knockdown of arkadia attenuated the induction of tgf beta target genes, whereas ectopically expressed arkadia enhanced it."
5522,19959502L7,19959502,"notably, over expression of arkadia inhibited the growth of hepg2 cells in the presence as well as the absence of tgf beta stimulation."
5523,19959502L8,19959502,"arkadia thus regulates the levels of expression of c ski protein in cell type dependent fashion, and exhibits a tumour suppressor function by inhibiting tumour cell growth."
5524,9013640L0,9013640,in recent years it has become apparent that the cellular machinery governing cell cycle progression and transcription control are often homologous in yeast and mammalian cells.
5525,9013640L1,9013640,"we and others have previously shown that the sp family of mammalian transcription factors regulates the transcription of a number of genes whose activities are governed by the product of the retinoblastoma (rb) susceptibility gene, including c fos, c myc, tgfbeta 1, igf ii, and c jun."
5526,9013640L2,9013640,"to determine whether a similar pathway of transcriptional regulation may function in yeast, we explored the possibility that transcription factors with nucleotide binding specificities akin to those of the sp family are expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe."
5527,9013640L3,9013640,"here we report the detection of novel yeast proteins (s. cerevisiae, p180; s. pombe, p200) that specifically bind rb regulated promoter elements in vitro dependent on nucleotides that are also required for binding and trans activation by sp family members in vivo."
5528,9013640L4,9013640,"our results indicate that the s. cerevisiae retinoblastoma control element binding activity 1) requires zinc for association with dna; 2) does not bind to scb, mcb, or e2f sites in vitro; 3) is cell cycle regulated in a swi6 independent fashion; and 4) maximally stimulates retinoblastoma control element mediated transcription in early  to mid s phase."
5529,9013640L5,9013640,"taken together, these data suggest that p180 may regulate the transcription of a subset of yeast genes whose expression is coincident with the onset and/or progression of dna replication."
5530,11464290L0,11464290,"we have shown earlier that the ifn beta and all trans retinoic acid (ra) combination, but not the single agents, induces death in several tumor cell lines."
5531,11464290L1,11464290,employing a genetic technique we have identified several genes associated with retinoid ifn induced mortality (grim).
5532,11464290L2,11464290,"one of the grims was human thioredoxin reductase (tr), a redox enzyme."
5533,11464290L3,11464290,"since the overexpressed tr augments ifn/ra stimulated cell death, we explored the mechanisms of tr mediated death."
5534,11464290L4,11464290,here we show that tr augments cell death by upregulating the transcriptional activity of p53 tumor suppressor.
5535,11464290L5,11464290,this process does not involve a physical increase in levels of p53.
5536,11464290L6,11464290,"using redox inactive mutants of tr and its substrate, thioredoxin (trx), we demonstrate that ifn/ra induced regulation of p53 dependent gene expression requires tr and trx."
5537,11464290L7,11464290,in contrast over expression of wildtype tr or trx augment the p53 dependent gene expression in response to ifn/ra treatment.
5538,11464290L8,11464290,consistent with these results an increased dna binding activity of p53 was noted in the presence of tr.

5540,4074333L0,4074333,"in addition to normal decarboxylation of glutamate to 4 aminobutyrate, glutamate decarboxylase from pig brain was shown to catalyse decarboxylation dependent transamination of l glutamate and direct transamination of 4 aminobutyrate with pyridoxal 5' phosphate to yield succinic semialdehyde and pyridoxamine 5' phosphate in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio."
5541,4074333L1,4074333,both reactions result in conversion of holoenzyme into apoenzyme.
5542,4074333L2,4074333,"with glutamate as substrate the rates of transamination differed markedly among the three forms of the enzyme (0.008, 0.012 and 0.029% of the rate of 4 aminobutyrate production by the alpha , beta  and gamma forms at ph 7.2) and accounted for the differences among the forms in rates of inactivation by glutamate and 4 aminobutyrate."
5543,4074333L3,4074333,"rates of transamination were maximal at about ph 8 and varied in parallel with the rate constants for inactivation from ph 6.5 to 8.0. rates of transamination of glutamate and 4 aminobutyrate were similar, suggesting that the decarboxylation step is not entirely rate limiting in the normal mechanism."
5544,4074333L4,4074333,"the transamination was reversible, and apoenzyme could be reconstituted to holoenzyme by reverse transamination with succinic semialdehyde and pyridoxamine 5' phosphate."
5545,4074333L5,4074333,"as a major route of apoenzyme formation, the transamination reaction appears to be physiologically significant and could account for the high proportion of apoenzyme in brain."
5546,2347071L0,2347071,a procedure was developed for the per cell estimation of catalase activities in suspensions and cultures of murine epidermal keratinocytes (meks).
5547,2347071L1,2347071,"per cell catalase activity in meks cultured in low ca2+ medium was relatively constant during the proliferation phase of culturing, but increased approximately 100% within 24 h of cessation of cell division."

5549,2347071L3,2347071,induction of mek differentiation by raising the medium ca2+ concentration resulted in rapid inhibition of cell division and approximately 200% increases in per cell catalase activities.
5550,2347071L4,2347071,addition of tpa immediately prior to ca2+ shift completely suppressed the ca2(+) dependent increases in activity.
5551,2347071L5,2347071,"however, the addition of tpa 48 h after the induction of differentiation by ca2+ shift had no effects on the elevated, pre existing catalase activities."
5552,2347071L6,2347071,per cell catalase activities varied in vivo with the stage of mek differentiation.
5553,2347071L7,2347071,"specifically, the lowest and highest per cell activities (approximately 4 fold difference) were measured in enriched basal cell and spinous cell populations respectively."
5554,2347071L8,2347071,catalase activity in the more differentiated meks was reduced approximately 33% within 24 h of topical treatment of dorsal skin with a promoting dose of tpa.
5555,2347071L9,2347071,"however, catalase activity in enriched basal cell preparations was unaffected."
5556,2347071L10,2347071,"collectively, these studies demonstrate that per cell catalase activities increase as meks differentiate, and that tpa suppresses the increases in catalase activities that normally occur during differentiation."

5566,23421996L6,23421996,"phosphorylation of prdx1 at thr ( 90) has been shown to inhibit its peroxidase activity; however, how exactly the activity of prdx1 is regulated by phosphorylation still remains unknown."
5567,23421996L7,23421996,"here, we demonstrate that pin1 facilitates the protein phosphatase 2a mediated dephosphorylation of prdx1, which helps to explain the accumulation of the inactive phosphorylated form of prdx1 in pin1 ( / ) mefs."

5578,12040841L1,12040841,the meaningfulness of elevated cardiac enzymes after revascularization procedures is one of the most controversial issues in interventional cardiology.
5579,12040841L2,12040841,the rate of periprocedural damage detection is highly dependent on the intensity of enzyme and ecg measurement.

5719,6487347L2,6487347,"comparison of the characteristics of the hemolysis induced by high and low citral concentrations, indicated that two mechanisms are involved  a non specific steroid  terpenoid or glutathione depletion mechanism dominating at high citral concentrations and a free radical mechanism dominating at low citral concentrations."
5720,6487347L3,6487347,experiments performed with various free radical scavengers indicate that 1o2 might be involved.
5721,17159902L0,17159902,mdm2 (hdm2) is a ubiquitin ligase that can target the p53 tumor suppressor protein for degradation.
5722,17159902L1,17159902,"the ring domain is essential for the e3 activity of mdm2, and we show here that the extreme c terminal tail of mdm2 is also critical for efficient e3 activity."
5723,17159902L2,17159902,"loss of e3 function in mdm2 mutants deleted of the c terminal tail correlated with a failure of these mutants to oligomerize with mdm2, or with the related protein mdmx (hdmx)."
5724,17159902L3,17159902,"however, mdm2 containing point mutations within the c terminus that inactivated e3 function retained the ability to oligomerize with the wild type mdm2 ring domain and mdmx, and our results indicate that oligomers containing both wild type mdm2 and a c terminal mutant protein retain e3 function both in auto degradation and degradation of p53."
5725,17159902L4,17159902,"interestingly, the e3 activity of c terminal point mutants of mdm2 can also be supported by interaction with wild type mdmx, suggesting that mdmx can directly contribute to e3 function."
5726,7659506L0,7659506,"na,k atpase alpha 1 subunit is an essential protein for cell growth and homeostasis."
5727,7659506L1,7659506,the gene coding for the protein is expressed in various types of tissues.
5728,7659506L2,7659506,we previously demonstrated that the transcription regulatory element of the gene (are) is located in the position  102 to  61 from the transcription initiation site.
5729,7659506L3,7659506,"to identify the minimal regions that are essential for the constitutive expression, the sequences of the are were analyzed in detail by in vitro transcription assays using nuclear extracts from rat kidney, brain and liver."
5730,7659506L4,7659506,the analyses of various mutations in the promoter demonstrated that the proximal region of the are is required for the efficient transcription in every nuclear extract.
5731,7659506L5,7659506,the factors binding to this region in these nuclear extracts exhibited identical mobility in gel retardation assays.
5732,7659506L6,7659506,the atf/cre core motif is indicated to be important for the factor binding and for the promoter function in all nuclear extracts.
5733,7659506L7,7659506,the common binding factor in the nuclear extracts was revealed to be an atf 1/creb heterodimer by gel retardation assays using specific antibodies.
5734,7659506L8,7659506,"we conclude that the atf 1/creb heterodimer is involved in the constitutive expression of the na,k atpase alpha 1 subunit gene."
5735,1920438L0,1920438,on the surface of protein molecules the formation of metal clusters during vacuum condensation is controlled by topochemical features of the substrate and by specific properties of the decorating material.
5736,1920438L1,1920438,the resulting metal distribution (decoration pattern) can be mapped by electron microscopy in conjunction with image processing.
5737,1920438L2,1920438,we have applied this technique to freeze etched crystals of the lumazine synthase riboflavin synthase complex and its derivative obtained by binding of the heteropolytungstate (nap5w30o110)(nh4)14.31 h2o.
5738,1920438L3,1920438,the decoration pattern of the free protein and its heteropolytungstate derivative showed marked differences.
5739,1920438L4,1920438,the correlation of these data with the x ray structure of the protein showed an increased affinity of both gold and silver to the location of heteropolytungstate.
5740,1920438L5,1920438,"decoration sites can, but do not need to, be close to the protein surface."
5741,1920438L6,1920438,"actually, two of the observed decoration sites are located on a layer of ice as thick as 20 a, which apparently transmits underlying topochemical features."
5742,1920438L7,1920438,preferential affinity of a site to a given metal must be seen as a property that depends on specific interaction with the decorating material but also on the differential affinities in adjacent areas.
5743,23326313L0,23326313,"gamma interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (gilt) is known to reduce disulfide bonds present in proteins internalized by antigen presenting cells, facilitating optimal processing and presentation of peptides on major histocompatibility complex class ii molecules, as well as the subsequent activation of cd4 positive t lymphocytes."
5744,23326313L1,23326313,"here, we show that gilt is required for class ii restricted processing and presentation of immunodominant epitopes from the major house dust mite allergen der p 1. in the absence of gilt, cd4 positive t cell responses to der p 1 are significantly reduced, resulting in mitigated allergic airway inflammation in response to der p 1 and house dust mite extracts in a murine model of asthma."

5753,12697178L0,12697178,the effects of h(2)o(2) and o(3) on the decomposition of trichloroethylene (tce) and perchloroethylene (pce) by gamma rays (gamma rays) were investigated in this work.
5754,12697178L1,12697178,"the combined gamma rays/o(3) process showed a synergistic effect and enhanced the removal of tce and pce compared with gamma rays alone, but, the gamma rays/h(2)o(2) process did not increase the removal."
5755,12697178L2,12697178,"this interesting result was successfully identified by an electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy/spin trapping method that can quantify hydroxyl radicals, which is directly related to the efficiency of tce and pce decomposition."
5756,12697178L3,12697178,"for gamma rays/h(2)o(2) system, there was no difference of hydroxyl radical production between gamma rays alone and gamma rays/h(2)o(2)."
5757,12697178L4,12697178,this indicates gamma rays cannot activate h(2)o(2) to produce hydroxyl radicals and this causes no increase of tce and pce removals.
5758,12697178L5,12697178,"to the contrary, the production of hydroxyl radicals was obviously increased in the case of gamma rays/o(3) process."
5759,12697178L6,12697178,"this suggests additional hydroxyl radicals are produced from the reaction of o(3) with the irradiation products of water such as hydrated electrons, hydrogen atoms, etc."

5761,11517148L0,11517148,is the fetal thyroid already capable to increase its iodide uptake in response to iodine deficiency?
5762,11517148L1,11517148,"to answer this question, we analyzed the expression of the na(+)/i( ) symporter and several other genes in the thyroid of rat fetuses at 21 d of gestation from control mothers presenting a mild or more severe iodine deficiency."
5763,11517148L2,11517148,"female rats were placed on a low iodine diet, not supplemented, or supplemented with iodide or perchlorate for 3 months."
5764,11517148L3,11517148,the maternal and fetal thyroidal iodide uptake was measured 24 h after injection of 10 microci na (125)i into the dams.
5765,11517148L4,11517148,"the absolute iodide uptake of the maternal thyroid was unchanged in a low iodine diet, not supplemented, compared with one supplemented with iodide."
5766,11517148L5,11517148,"in contrast, the fetal thyroid absolute iodide uptake of a low iodine diet, not supplemented, and one supplemented with perchlorate was decreased by 70% and 95% compared with that supplemented with iodide."

5768,11517148L7,11517148,"na(+)/i( ) symporter expression was induced in the fetal side of the placenta in both a low iodine diet, not supplemented, and one supplemented with perchlorate; in contrast, na(+)/i( ) symporter mrna was never detected in the maternal side of the placenta."
5769,11517148L8,11517148,fetal thyroid thyroglobulin and type i deiodinase mrna contents were only significantly increased with a diet supplemented with perchlorate.
5770,11517148L9,11517148,"glucose transporter 4 mrna was decreased in the fetal thyroid of both a low iodine diet, not supplemented, and one supplemented with perchlorate compared with one supplemented with iodide."
5771,11517148L10,11517148,"in conclusion, although the up regulation of na(+)/i( ) symporter expression in fetal thyroid and placenta in the low iodine diet, not supplemented group did not lead to restoration of a normal absolute iodide uptake, our data show that all adaptive and/or defending mechanisms against iodine deficiency are already present in the fetus."

5824,22106224L3,22106224,these cystic fibrosis isolates contained probable gain of function pmrb alleles that conferred polymyxin resistance to strains with a wild type or pmrab deletion background.
5825,22106224L4,22106224,double mutant pmrb alleles that contained mutations in both the periplasmic and dimerization phosphotransferase domains markedly augmented polymyxin resistance.

5838,2552001L0,2552001,it has been shown that the addition of a beta adrenergic catecholamine to a trout red blood cell suspension induces a 60 100 fold increase of sodium permeability resulting from the activation of a camp dependent na+/h+ antiport.
5839,2552001L1,2552001,"subsequent addition of propranolol almost instantaneously reduces the intracellular camp concentration, and thus the na permeability, to their basal values (mahé et al., 1985)."

5841,2552001L3,2552001,glutaraldehyde alone causes a rapid decrease in the cellular camp concentration.
5842,2552001L4,2552001,in its fixed state the antiporter is fully amiloride sensitive.
5843,2552001L5,2552001,"the switching on of the na+/h+ exchange by camp is rapidly (2 min) followed by acute but progressive desensitization of the exchanger (garcia romeu et al., 1988)."
5844,2552001L6,2552001,"the desensitization depends on the concentration of external sodium, being maximal at a normal na concentration (145 mm) and nonexistent at a low na concentration (20 mm)."
5845,2552001L7,2552001,"if glutaraldehyde is added after activation in nondesensitizing conditions (20 mm na), transfer to a na rich medium induces only a very slight desensitization: thus the fixative can ""freeze"" the exchanger in the nondesensitizing conformation."
5846,2552001L8,2552001,"no3  inhibits the activity of the camp dependent na+/h+ antiporter of the trout red blood cell (borgese et al., 1986)."
5847,2552001L9,2552001,"if glutaraldehyde is added when the cells are activated by camp in a chloride containing medium, the activity of the exchanger is no longer inhibited when cl  is replaced by no3 ."
5848,2552001L10,2552001,"conversely, after fixation in no3  medium replacement of no3  by cl  has very little stimulatory effect."
5849,2552001L11,2552001,this indicates that the anion dependence is not a specific requirement for the exchange process but that the anion environment is critical for the switching on of the na+/h+ exchanger and for the maintenance of its activated configuration.

5980,19759245L6,19759245,"lipid accumulation was also significantly diminished in preadipocytes differentiated in the presence of 100 micromol/l 1,2 dt ( 37%) compared with controls."
5981,19759245L7,19759245,"furthermore, 100 micromol/l 1,2 dt treatment for 10 d significantly reduced ppargamma activity ( 27%)."
5982,19759245L8,19759245,"the protein expression of perilipin and the secretion levels for 2 adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, were significantly diminished in 1,2 dt cultured preadipocytes ( 37,  51, and  43%, respectively)."
5983,19759245L9,19759245,"moreover, the secretion of inflammatory molecules (interleukin 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) induced by macrophage secreted factors was partially abolished in 100 micromol/l 1,2 dt treated preadipocytes ( 28 and  25%, respectively)."
5984,19759245L10,19759245,"in conclusion, we demonstrated that 1,2 dt, a garlic derived organosulfur, has antiadipogenic and antiinflammatory actions on human preadipocytes and may be a novel, antiobesity nutraceutical."
5985,9453277L0,9453277,previous studies suggest that nitric oxide (no) is involved in headaches induced by i.v.

5987,9453277L2,9453277,"extending these studies to sufferers of migraine without aura, it was found that migraineurs experienced a stronger headache than non migraineurs."
5988,9453277L3,9453277,"in addition, most migraineurs experienced a delayed migraine attack at variable times (mean 5.5 h) after gtn provocation."
5989,9453277L4,9453277,this biphasic headache response in migraineurs may be linked to hypersensitivity in the no cgmp pathway.
5990,9453277L5,9453277,"thus, compared to controls, migraineurs were found to be more sensitive to gtn induced intracranial arterial dilatation, which is known to be mediated via liberation of no and subsequent synthesis of cgmp furthermore, histamine infusions in migraineurs induced headache responses and intracranial arterial responses resembling those induced by gtn in migraineurs."
5991,9453277L6,9453277,"histamine is known to liberate no from the endothelium via stimulation of the h1 receptor, which is present in the large intracranial arteries in man."
5992,9453277L7,9453277,"because both immediate histamine induced headache and intracranial arterial dilatation and delayed histamine induced migraine are blocked by h1 receptor blockade, a likely common pathway for gtn and histamine induced headaches/migraines and intracranial arterial responses may be via activation of the no cgmp pathway."
5993,9453277L8,9453277,the delay in the development of these experimental migraines may reflect activation of multiple physiological processes.
5994,9453277L9,9453277,the intracranial arteries of migraineurs were found supersensitive to the vasodilating effect of gtn (exogenous no).
5995,9453277L10,9453277,this relates to clinical findings suggesting dilatation of the large intracranial arteries on the headache side during spontaneous migraine attacks.
5996,9453277L11,9453277,the function of arterial regulatory mechanisms involving no in migraine was therefore studied.
5997,9453277L12,9453277,"in peripheral arteries, no endothelial dysfunction of no was found and cardiovascular and intracranial arterial sympathetic function was normal."
5998,9453277L13,9453277,"a mild parasympathetic dysfunction may be involved and may, via denervation supersensitivity, be responsible for the observed supersensitivity to no."
5999,9453277L14,9453277,another possibility is that no initiates a perivascular neurogenic inflammation with liberation of vasoactive peptides.
6000,9453277L15,9453277,no also mediates a variety of other physiological phenomena.
6001,9453277L16,9453277,"one of these, the pain modulating effect observed in animals, was evaluated in a human study using gtn infusion and measurements of pain thresholds."
6002,9453277L17,9453277,no definite effects of gtn were demonstrated.
6003,9453277L18,9453277,the precise mechanisms involved in no triggered migraines and which part of the no activated cascade that is involved remain to be determined.

6006,2924400L1,2924400,"only methapyrilene produced notable histopathological changes in the liver, bile duct hyperplasia and focal cellular change."
6007,2924400L2,2924400,"methapyrilene produced an early and persistent elevation in the ratio of s adenosylmethionine to s adenosylhomocysteine, which was 2.8 times the control levels at 34 weeks; none of the other antihistamines produced so high a ratio or altered the ratio as early."
6008,2924400L3,2924400,"methapyrilene, but not the other antihistamines, produced a significant increase in the methylation of liver dna at 20 and 34 weeks, as measured by the level of 5 methyldeoxycytidine."

6014,24878114L1,24878114,"three dimensional (3 d) cultures of hepatocyte spheroids may be superior to monolayer cultures for evaluating drug metabolism and toxicity because hepatocytes in spheroids maintain the expression of various metabolizing enzymes and transporters, such as cytochrome p450 (cyp)."
6015,24878114L2,24878114,"in this study, we examined the hepatotoxicity due to metabolic activation of acetaminophen (apap) using fluorescent indicators of cell viability and intracellular levels of glutathione (gsh) in rat hepatocyte spheroids grown on micro space cell culture plates."

6019,24878114L6,24878114,"apap (10mm, 24h) decreased the levels of both intracellular atp and gsh, and gsh conjugated apap (apap gsh) were formed."
6020,24878114L7,24878114,"all three effects were blocked by abt, confirming a contribution of apap metabolic activation by cyp to spheroid toxicity."
6021,24878114L8,24878114,fluorometric imaging of hepatocyte spheroids on micro space cell culture plates may allow the screening of drug induced hepatotoxicity during pharmaceutical development.

6040,16302845L9,16302845,"altogether, our results indicate that endogenous pen2 and aph1al do not undergo proteasomal degradation under physiological conditions in hek 293 cells, tsm1 cells and fibroblasts and that the clearance of pen2 in ps  and nct deficient fibroblasts is not mediated by 20s proteasome."
6041,16302845L10,16302845,whether the 26s proteasome participates to pen2 proteolysis in deficient fibroblasts remains to be established.

6060,7545090L8,7545090,"the data are consistent with the notion that ca2+ entry into ht29/b6 cells is regulated by endothelial nos/no and gc/cgmp, but effects are most pronounced in store depleted cells."
6061,7545090L9,7545090,"thus, no and cgmp appear to potentiate the action of messengers released from the store during the emptying process, but no and cgmp have only small effects of their own to open the ca2+ channel in the plasma membrane."

6068,22614019L5,22614019,the increased sensitivity of transformed keratinocytes to mir 21's effects occurs in part through downregulation of the rna binding protein dnd1 during the transformation process.

6111,20175995L2,20175995,the mammalian ca family contains 16 different isoforms of which 13 are enzymatically active.
6112,20175995L3,20175995,"we have conducted a systematic screening by rt pcr on the expression of all known ca isoforms in mouse enamel organ epithelium (eoe) cells dissected from new born, in secretory ameloblasts derived from 7 day old animals, and in the ls8 ameloblast cell line."
6113,20175995L4,20175995,results show that all ca isoforms are expressed by eoe/ameloblast cells in vivo.
6114,20175995L5,20175995,"the most highly expressed are the catalytic isozymes ca ii, vi, ix, and xiii, and the acatalytic ca xi isoform."
6115,20175995L6,20175995,"only minor differences were found in ca expression levels between 1 day eoe cells and 7 day old secretory stage ameloblasts, whereas ls8 cells expressed fewer ca isoforms than both of these."
6116,20175995L7,20175995,the broad expression of cas by ameloblasts reported here contributes to our understanding of ph homeostasis during enamel development and demonstrates its complexity.
6117,20175995L8,20175995,our results also highlight the critical role that regulation of ph plays during the development of enamel.
6118,19500556L0,19500556,this work describes a new electrochemical sensor for hydrogen peroxide based on tin pentacyanonitrosylferrate (snpcnf) modified carbon ceramic electrode (cce).
6119,19500556L1,19500556,the modified electrode was constructed by using a sol gel technique involving two steps: construction of cce containing metallic tin (sn) powder and then electrochemical creation of snpcnf film on the surface of cce.
6120,19500556L2,19500556,"the modified electrode was characterized by energy dispersive x ray, fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry (cv) techniques."
6121,19500556L3,19500556,the charge transfer coefficient (alpha) and charge transfer rate constant (k(s)) for the modifying film were calculated.
6122,19500556L4,19500556,the electrocatalytic activity of the modified electrode toward the reduction of hydrogen peroxide was studied by cv and chronoamperometry.
6123,19500556L5,19500556,a linear calibration curve was obtained over the hydrogen peroxide concentration range of 0.5 to 69.4 microm using a hydrodynamic amperometric technique.
6124,19500556L6,19500556,"the limit of detection (for a signal to noise ratio of 3) and sensitivity were found to be 92 nm and 0.89 microa/microm, respectively."
6125,19500556L7,19500556,"furthermore, the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen peroxide (d) and catalytic rate constant (k(cat)) were calculated."
6126,59732L0,59732,surgical samples of human prostate were explanted and submitted to constant flow organ culture.
6127,59732L1,59732,"the medium contained 3h testosterone 50 nm, and except for controls, increasing concentrations of human serum albumin (hsa) or human sex steroid binding plasma protein (sbp)."
6128,59732L2,59732,"at steady state, the explants were washed and homogenized, and the total radioactivity, radioactive testosterone, androstanolone (17 beta hydroxyandrostan 3 one), androstane 3 alpha, 17 beta diol, and androstane 3 beta, 17 beta diol were determined after the addition of the corresponding internal 14c standards."
6129,59732L3,59732,"from these data, testosterone uptake and metabolism were quantitated."
6130,59732L4,59732,the concentration of unbound testosterone in protein supplemented culture media was measured separately by equilibrium dialysis.
6131,59732L5,59732,"in control superfusions without protein, the tissue concentration of total radioactive steroids was equivalent to 182 +/  18 (mean +/  sem) pmoles/g of prostate."
6132,59732L6,59732,"androstanolone represented about 2/3, testosterone 1/10, and the two androstanediols together 1/10 of the total radioactivity."
6133,59732L7,59732,"no difference was found between ""normal"" and hyperplastic prostate explants."
6134,59732L8,59732,"in experiments with hsa (15 176 mum), is was observed that the uptake of radioactive testosterone in the prostate explants was decreased in direct proportion to the unbound testosterone fraction of the superfusion medium, but the proportions of testosterone metabolities in the superfused explants remained the same."
6135,59732L9,59732,"in experiments with sbp (6 135 nm), the concentrations of unbound testosterone in the superfusion medium were reduced to the same levels as in the experiments with hsa."
6136,59732L10,59732,"the reduction of tissue radioactivity was somewhat larger than that expected from the reduction of unbound testosterone in the superfusion medium for the concentrations of sbp less than 50 nm, and then remained approximately constant."
6137,59732L11,59732,"in addition, sbp altered the metabolism of testosterone: the androstanolone/testosterone ratio in the prostate explants was critically dependent upon the sbp concentration in the superfusion medium."
6138,59732L12,59732,"it is therefore suggested that, independent of its effect on the binding of testosterone, sbp has a direct effect on testosterone uptake and metabolism by the human prostate."
6139,59732L13,59732,the underlying mechanism is unknown.
6140,12534278L0,12534278,the villin headpiece folds autonomously in vitro forming three alpha helical regions.
6141,12534278L1,12534278,"local propensities, however, strongly disfavor the formation of the c terminal helix because most native residue pairs in that helix are hydrophobic/polar mismatches."
6142,12534278L2,12534278,even the n terminal helix is unfavored according to the agadir criterion.
6143,12534278L3,12534278,"our coarse grained ab initio simulations reveal three body correlations in which hydrophobic residues position to protect amide carbonyl hydrogen bonds from attack by water, thus inducing the growth of the c terminal helix and guiding the folding process."
6144,12534278L4,12534278,similar correlations are also found in all atom simulations with an implicit solvent model that accurately reproduces the results of simulations with explicit solvent molecules.
6145,12534278L5,12534278,"the correlations establish a large scale, many body context that may be probed experimentally by introducing mutations of certain nonobvious residues that reside outside the native hydrophobic core but that are predicted to affect the folding rates and dynamics dramatically."
6146,8880426L0,8880426,two experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of sows to high levels of dietary riboflavin.
6147,8880426L1,8880426,"responses evaluated were erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (egrac, a biochemical indicator of riboflavin status) and reproductive performance."
6148,8880426L2,8880426,in exp.
6149,8880426L3,8880426,"1, eight sows were fed diets either slightly deficient or superadequate in riboflavin throughout a reproductive cycle, beginning in midgestation."
6150,8880426L4,8880426,the egrac values confirmed the slight deficiency (p < .01) but did not clearly show a time when the sow is most likely to be deficient in riboflavin.
6151,8880426L5,8880426,in exp.
6152,8880426L6,8880426,"2, 118 sows at two farms were fed diets providing 10 (control, 1.4 times the nrc [1988] requirement estimate), 60, 110, or 160 mg of riboflavin/d for 21 d beginning at breeding, and the control level through the remainder of the reproductive cycle."
6153,8880426L7,8880426,"the percentage of sows farrowing tended to be lower (p < .10) for the control sows than for sows fed the other treatments (66.7, 85.7, 93.3, and 86.7% for 10, 60, 110, and 160 mg/d, respectively)."
6154,8880426L8,8880426,this response is similar to other results reported previously.
6155,8880426L9,8880426,"no other measure of reproductive performance nor egrac measured at any of five stages of the reproductive cycle, was affected by treatment."
6156,8880426L10,8880426,these results suggest that massive riboflavin supplementation of the sows' diet during early pregnancy may increase the percentage of farrowing but does no increase litter size.
6157,2129102L0,2129102,"expression of the proto oncogenes c fos and c jun was analysed in the insulin producing rat tumor cell line, rin 5ah."
6158,2129102L1,2129102,"addition of fetal calf serum (fcs) to serum starved cells in the presence of cycloheximid induced a modest increase in c fos and c jun mrna levels, whereas growth hormone (gh) in the presence of cycloheximid had little or no effect, when added to rin 5ah cells maintained in 0.5% fcs for 2 days prior to stimulation."
6159,2129102L2,2129102,"activation of protein kinase c by phorbol ester lead to increased c jun and c fos mrna levels, whereas activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin increased c fos mrna levels."
6160,2129102L3,2129102,these results suggest that the effects of gh on insulin producing cells are not mediated by activation of c fos and c jun transcription.
6161,22545970L0,22545970,"our previous studies with the use of non selective cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitor, indomethacin, demonstrated that prostanoids produced during endotoxaemia increase inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) protein expression and nitric oxide synthesis, and decrease cyctochrome p450 (cyp) 4a1 protein expression and cyp 4a activity."
6162,22545970L1,22545970,the results suggest that dual inhibition of inos and cox by indomethacin restores blood pressure presumably due to increased production of 20 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20 hete) derived from cyp 4a in endotoxaemic rats.
6163,22545970L2,22545970,"the present study examined whether increased levels of vasoconstrictor eicosanoids, 20 hete, prostaglandin f(2α) (pgf(2α) )and thromboxane a(2) (txa(2) ), would contribute to the effect of selective cox 2 inhibition to prevent endotoxin (et) induced fall in blood pressure associated with an increase in the production of vasodilator prostanoids, prostaglandin i(2) (pgi(2) ) and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2) ) and nitric oxide synthesis."
6164,22545970L3,22545970,mean arterial blood pressure fell by 31 mmhg and heart rate (hr) rose by 90 beats/min.
6165,22545970L4,22545970,"in male wistar rats treated with et (10 mg/kg, i.p.)."
6166,22545970L5,22545970,"the fall in mean arterial pressure and increase in hr were associated with increased levels of 6 keto prostaglandin f(1α) (6 keto pgf(1α) ), pge(2) , txb(2) , and nitrite in the serum, kidney, heart, thoracic aorta and/or superior mesenteric artery."
6167,22545970L6,22545970,systemic and renal 20 hete and pgf(2α) levels were also decreased in endotoxaemic rats.
6168,22545970L7,22545970,"these effects of et were prevented by a selective cox 2 inhibitor, n (2 cyclohexyloxy 4 nitrophenyl)methansulphonamide (10 mg/kg, i.p."
6169,22545970L8,22545970,"), given 1 hr after injection of et."
6170,22545970L9,22545970,"these data suggest that an increase in 20 hete and pgf(2α) levels associated with decreased production of pgi(2) , pge(2) , and txa(2) , and nitric oxide synthesis contributes to the effect of selective cox 2 inhibitor to prevent the hypotension during rat endotoxaemia."
6171,22876341L0,22876341,the oxidative effect of nicotine was investigated using androgen biomarkers of redox status and wound healing in fibroblasts; using the antioxidant glutathione for confirmation of responses.
6172,22876341L1,22876341,"cultures of human gingival (hgf) and periosteal fibroblasts (hpf) were incubated with substrates 14c testosterone/14c 4 androstenedione in the presence or absence of serial concentrations of nicotine (n(100 500)), glutathione (g(1 5)) and their combinations, in medium."
6173,22876341L2,22876341,"at 24 h the medium was solvent extracted for metabolites, separated by tlc and quantified using radioisotope scanning."
6174,22876341L3,22876341,"nicotine caused significant inhibition in yields of the physiologically active metabolite 5α dihydrotestosterone (dht) in hgf and hpf, overcome to varying degrees by the anti oxidant glutathione (n = 6; p<0.01, one way anova); this is suggestive of moderation of an oxidative mechanism induced by nicotine."
6175,22876341L4,22876341,down regulation of 5α reductase activity by nicotine resulting in reduced yields of dht was overcome by glutathione.
6176,22876341L5,22876341,overcoming oxidative stress in a redox environment is applicable to treatment outcome.
6177,24266647L0,24266647,the electrochemical mineralization mechanism of environmentally persistent perfluorooctanoic acid (pfoa) at a ce doped modified porous nanocrystalline pbo2 film anode was investigated using density functional theory (dft) simulation and further validated experimentally.
6178,24266647L1,24266647,the potential energy surface was mapped out for all possible reactions during electrochemical mineralization reaction of pfoa.
6179,24266647L2,24266647,"the hydroxyl radical (·oh), o2 and h2o took part in the mineralization process and played different roles."
6180,24266647L3,24266647,"the ·oh initiated process was found to be the main degradation pathway, and the existence of o2 obviously accelerated the degradation process of pfoa in aqueous solution."
6181,24266647L4,24266647,"on the basis of the dft calculations, an optimal electrochemical mineralization mechanism of pfoa was proposed, which involved the electronic migration, decarboxylation, radical reaction, hydrogen abstraction reaction, and radical fragmentation reaction."
6182,24266647L5,24266647,the proposed mechanism was verified by the dynamics and intermediate determination experiments.
6183,24266647L6,24266647,"furthermore, the observed ·oh concentration showed that the electrolysis system could produce enough ·oh for pfoa mineralization process, indicating that the proposed ·oh initiated process derived from dft calculations was feasible."
6184,24266647L7,24266647,these insightful findings are instrumental for a comprehensive understanding of the mineralization of pfoa in the electrolysis system.
6185,12163080L0,12163080,"the first high resolution structure of a p type atpase, that of the ca(2+) atpase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, was published in 2000. this structure has provided many clues to how the ca(2+) atpase might work, but no complete answers."
6186,12163080L1,12163080,the ca(2+) atpase structure reveals no clear pathway from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane to the pair of high affinity binding sites for ca(2+) located in the transmembrane region of the atpase and no clear pathway from these sites to the lumenal side of the membrane.
6187,12163080L2,12163080,the atpase is therefore very unlike an ion channel in its construction.
6188,12163080L3,12163080,it is unclear from the crystal structure of the ca(2+) atpase exactly how the protein sits within the lipid bilayer that surrounds it in the membrane.
6189,12163080L4,12163080,the ca(2+) atpase is implicated in thermogenesis in some types of muscle; this could involve processes of slippage and leak modulated by interaction between the ca(2+) atpase and sarcolipin.

6197,19298700L7,19298700,"addition of eugenosedin a to the high fat diet resulted in less weight gain and reduced hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia."
6198,19298700L8,19298700,"lipid and glucose homeostasis were related to decreased hepatic lipogenesis mrnas and proteins (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1a, fatty acid synthase, sterol coa desaturase) and restored adipose peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma expression."
6199,19298700L9,19298700,eugenosedin a also enhanced low density lipoprotein receptor mrna expression.
6200,19298700L10,19298700,"eugenosedin a may improve plasma lipid metabolism by increasing low density lipoprotein receptor and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma expression and diminishing sterol regulatory element binding protein 1a, fatty acid synthase and sterol coa desaturase."
6201,19298700L11,19298700,"reduction of plasma glucose and lipid levels may, in turn, reduce insulin concentration, which would explain the marked improvement in obesity related hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia."
6202,19298700L12,19298700,"furthermore, eugenosedin a affected malondialdehyde concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity, suggesting it may have anti peroxidation effects in mice fed a high fat diet."

6208,27597883L5,27597883,mirnas array analysis identified 131 differentially expressed mirnas (125 were upregulated and 6 were downregulated) and predicted 13504 putative target genes of the deregulated mirnas.
6209,27597883L6,27597883,gene ontology (go) analysis revealed that the putative target genes were associated with h2o2 induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis.
6210,27597883L7,27597883,"the subsequent bioinformatics analysis indicated that h2o2 response pathways, including mapk signaling pathway, apoptosis, and pathways in cancer and cell cycle, were significantly affected."
6211,27597883L8,27597883,"overall, these results provided comprehensive information on the biological function of h2o2 treatment in hepg2 cells."
6212,27597883L9,27597883,the identification of mirnas and their putative targets may offer new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for liver cancer.

6240,11511177L1,11511177,"we investigated the first step in the degradation of ca sg to the mercapturic acid conjugate, clofibryl s acyl n acetylcysteine (ca snac), which is catalyzed by gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma gt)."
6241,11511177L2,11511177,"after gamma gt mediated cleavage of glutamate from ca sg, the product clofibryl s acyl cysteinylglycine (ca s cg) should undergo an intramolecular rearrangement reaction [tate, s. s. (1975) febs lett."

6243,11511177L4,11511177,"we performed in vitro studies incubating ca sg with gamma gt to determine the products formed, and in vivo studies examining the products excreted in urine after dosing rats with ca sg or ca."
6244,11511177L5,11511177,"thus, ca sg (0.1 mm) was incubated with gamma gt (0.1 unit/ml) in buffer (ph 7.4, 25 degrees c) and analyzed for products formed by reversed phase hplc and electrospray mass spectrometry (esi/ms)."
6245,11511177L6,11511177,"results showed that ca sg is degraded completely after 6 h of incubation leading to the formation of two products, ca n cg and its disulfide, with no detection of ca s cg thioester."
6246,11511177L7,11511177,"after 36 h of incubation, only the disulfide remained in the incubation."
6247,11511177L8,11511177,treatment of the disulfide with dithiothreitol led to the reappearance of ca n cg.
6248,11511177L9,11511177,"esi/lc/ms analysis of urine (16 h) extracts of ca sg dosed rats (200 mg/kg, iv) showed that ca sg is degraded to ca n cg, ca n acyl cysteine (ca n c) and their respective s methylated products."
6249,11511177L10,11511177,the mercapturic acid conjugate (ca snac) was found as a minor product.
6250,11511177L11,11511177,"analysis of urine extracts from ca dosed rats (200 mg/kg, ip) resulted in the detection of clofibryl n acyl cysteine (ca n c), but no evidence for the formation of ca snac was obtained."
6251,11511177L12,11511177,these in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that gamma gt mediated degradation of clofibryl s acyl glutathione leads primarily to the formation and excretion of clofibryl n acyl cysteine products rather than the s acyl nac conjugate.
6252,12087079L0,12087079,"steroid hormone receptor co factors are abundantly expressed in the uterus in order to modify steroid hormone receptor action, either leading to activation or repression of transcription in the endometrium."
6253,12087079L1,12087079,"however, the role of co factors in remodelling of the human endometrium has not been established."
6254,12087079L2,12087079,we therefore endeavoured to evaluate the presence of the co activator src (steroid receptor co activator) 1 and the co repressors n cor (nuclear receptor co repressor) and steroid co repressor smrt (silencing mediator of retinod and thyroid) receptors in the human endometrium during the different phases of the menstrual cycle.
6255,12087079L3,12087079,"by using a real time rt pcr assay, we showed that src 1, n cor and smrt mrna are expressed in human endometrium during all phases of the menstrual cycle, as well as in inactive endometrium."
6256,12087079L4,12087079,"moreover, endometrial expression of src 1 and n cor mrna increased during menstruation when compared with the other phases of the menstrual cycle (p < 0.001)."
6257,12087079L5,12087079,immunohistochemistry demonstrated that src 1 and n cor stain positive in the glandular epithelium and stroma in menstrual phase endometrium.
6258,12087079L6,12087079,the staining was weak in proliferative and secretory endometrium and absent in inactive endometrium.
6259,12087079L7,12087079,our results suggest that differential expression of endometrial steroid receptor co factors probably play a role in the regulation of human endometrium remodelling.
6260,26377798L0,26377798,podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells located at the outer aspects of the glomerular capillary tuft and critical components of the kidney filtration barrier.
6261,26377798L1,26377798,"to maintain their unique features, podocytes express a number of proteins that are only sparsely found elsewhere in the body."

6265,26377798L5,26377798,"expressional studies in developing kidneys show that these proteins are first expressed at the capillary stage glomerulus, the same stage when the formation of major and foot processes begins."
6266,26377798L6,26377798,we identified zebrafish orthologs for tmem234 and znf185 genes and knocked down their expression using morpholino technology.
6267,26377798L7,26377798,"studies in zebrafish larvae indicate that tmem234 is essential for the organization and functional integrity of the pronephric glomerulus filtration barrier, as inactivation of tmem234 expression results in foot process effacement and proteinuria."
6268,26377798L8,26377798,"in summary, we have identified four novel highly podocyte enriched proteins and show that one of them, tmem234, is essential for the normal filtration barrier in the zebrafish pronephric glomerulus."
6269,26377798L9,26377798,identification of new molecular components of the kidney filtration barrier opens up possibilities to study their role in glomerulus biology and diseases.

6277,25049163L0,25049163,this study aims to uncover the spatiotemporal involvement of glutathione (gsh) in two major mechanisms of cadmium (cd) induced detoxification (i.e.
6278,25049163L1,25049163,chelation and antioxidative defence).
6279,25049163L2,25049163,a kinetic study was conducted on hydroponically grown arabidopsis thaliana (l. heyhn) to gain insight into the early events after exposure to cd.

6292,14983750L5,14983750,clinical examination during the puerperal phase revealed that cyclicity had started statistically significantly more often in control cows than in the cows receiving carofertin.
6293,14983750L6,14983750,"with regard to the other parameters, no significant group differences were found."

6295,14983750L8,14983750,these results suggest that the use of carofertin in dairy cows under the given experimental conditions for therapy or prophylaxis of fertility disorders might not be recommendable.
6296,12375647L0,12375647,follicular lymphoma (fl) is a low grade lymphoma that typically lacks cd5 antigen expression.
6297,12375647L1,12375647,we report 3 cases of fl with unusual expression of cd5.
6298,12375647L2,12375647,"all cases showed histologic features of fl, including effaced nodal architecture, follicular growth pattern, and a spectrum of grades from 1 to 3 using world health organization criteria."

6368,22888639L6,22888639,in tonsil fcrl1 positive cells were located in crypt area: in mantle zone of secondary lymphoid follicles and among cells of lymphoepithelium.
6369,22888639L7,22888639,fcrl1 positive cells were also found in b cell follicles of the spleen.
6370,12821662L0,12821662,normal cells are dependent upon integrin mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix for cell proliferation and survival.
6371,12821662L1,12821662,integrins regulate these processes partially through control of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (erk1/2).
6372,12821662L2,12821662,a trait of malignant cells is their ability to undergo anchorage independent growth.
6373,12821662L3,12821662,"melanomas are tumors arising from normal melanocytes that, if undetected at an early stage, are highly invasive and poorly treatable."
6374,12821662L4,12821662,"proliferation of melanoma cells and melanocytes is dependent upon erk1/2 signaling, and mutation of b raf, a component of the erk1/2 pathway, is commonly found in melanomas."
6375,12821662L5,12821662,we addressed the role of integrin mediated adhesion in erk1/2 signaling in human melanoma cells and primary melanocytes.
6376,12821662L6,12821662,"basal erk1/2 activity was low, and growth factor activation was adhesion dependent in normal human melanocytes."
6377,12821662L7,12821662,"by contrast in mutant b raf expressing melanoma cells (sk mel 24 and sk mel 28), the erk1/2 pathway was constitutively active, and adhesion dependent regulation of erk1/2 activity was by passed."
6378,12821662L8,12821662,"furthermore, in melanoma cells, erk1/2 translocated to the nucleus and regulated transcription events in an adhesion independent manner."
6379,12821662L9,12821662,expression of mutant v599e b raf in normal melanocytes was sufficient to promote adhesion independent erk1/2 signaling.
6380,12821662L10,12821662,these results indicate that alterations in the adhesion requirement for erk1/2 signaling in melanocytes are associated with the acquisition of malignant cell behavior.
6381,3218159L0,3218159,three series of experiments were conducted to study the effects of varying food factors on lipid peroxidation (lpo) activity in rat liver microsomes.
6382,3218159L1,3218159,"the food rations contained heat treated sunflower oil, soybean protein isolate, krill protein concentrate."
6383,3218159L2,3218159,"a long term intake of heat treated oxidation products was attended by significant activation of lpo in the enzymatic system, by elevation of cytochrome p 450 level, by increased activity of ethylmorphine n demethylase and aniline n hydroxylation."
6384,3218159L3,3218159,the period of half inactivation of cytochrome p 450 was significantly shortened in nadph dependent lpo.
6385,3218159L4,3218159,the rate of nadph dependent lpo was not significantly different in the animals given equal amounts of soybean protein isolate or casein (control).
6386,3218159L5,3218159,activation of nadph dependent lpo and induction of cytochrome p 450 were recorded in liver microsomes of the animals given krill protein.
6387,3218159L6,3218159,the high concentration of cytochrome p 450 (in the homogenate and microsomes) correlated with the acceleration of hydroxylation of standard substrates ethylmorphine and aniline.
6388,7680760L0,7680760,experiments were carried out to investigate whether or not depletion of the glutathione (gsh) level in drosophila melanogaster larvae with buthionine sulfoximine (bso) treatment can result in the modulation of the frequency of sex linked recessive lethal (slrl) mutations induced by gamma radiation.
6389,7680760L1,7680760,third instar larvae were fed on bso for 24 h before exposure to 10 gy gamma radiation.
6390,7680760L2,7680760,"immediately after this the larvae were divided into two batches, which were used for determining the gsh level and the induction of slrl mutations respectively."
6391,7680760L3,7680760,the results obtained suggest that the depletion of the gsh level with bso can lead to an enhancement in the frequency of slrl mutations (significant at the 5% level).
6392,7680760L4,7680760,"in a subsequent experiment in which adult drosophila melanogaster male flies were fed on bso for 72 h before irradiation, a significant increase was observed in the incidence of slrl mutations."
6393,22895052L0,22895052,"the e2f family of transcription factors contributes to oncogenesis through activation of multiple genes involved in cellular proliferation, a process that is opposed by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (rb)."
6394,22895052L1,22895052,"rb also increases e2f1 stability by inhibiting its proteasome mediated degradation, but the consequences of this post translational regulation of e2f1 remain unknown."
6395,22895052L2,22895052,"to better understand the mechanism of e2f stabilization and its physiological relevance, we examined the streamlined rbf1 de2f1 network in drosophila."
6396,22895052L3,22895052,"during embryonic development, rbf1 is insulated from ubiquitin mediated turnover by the cop9 signalosome, a multi protein complex that modulates e3 ubiquitin ligase activity."
6397,22895052L4,22895052,"here, we report that the cop9 signalosome also protects the cullin4 e3 ligase that is responsible for de2f1 proteasome mediated destruction."
6398,22895052L5,22895052,"this dual role of the cop9 signalosome may serve to buffer e2f levels, enhancing its turnover via cul4 protection and its stabilization through protection of rbf1."
6399,22895052L6,22895052,we further show that rbf1 mediated stabilization of de2f1 and repression of de2f1 cell cycle target genes are distinct properties.
6400,22895052L7,22895052,removal of an evolutionarily conserved rbf1 c terminal degron disabled rbf1 repression without affecting de2f1 stabilization.
6401,22895052L8,22895052,"this mutant form of rbf1 also enhanced g(1) to s phase progression when expressed in rbf1 containing s2 embryonic cells, suggesting that such mutations may generate gain of function properties relevant to cellular transformation."
6402,22895052L9,22895052,"consistent with this idea, several studies have identified mutations in the homologous c terminal domains of rb and p130 in human cancer."
6403,25160625L0,25160625,metal ion assimilation is essential for all forms of life.
6404,25160625L1,25160625,"however, organisms must properly control the availability of these nutrients within the cell to avoid inactivating proteins by mismetallation."
6405,25160625L2,25160625,"to safeguard against an imbalance between supply and demand in eukaryotes, intracellular compartments contain metal transporters that load and unload metals."
6406,25160625L3,25160625,"although the vacuoles of saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis thaliana are well established locales for the storage of copper, zinc, iron, and manganese, related compartments are emerging as important mediators of metal homeostasis."
6407,25160625L4,25160625,here we describe these compartments and review their metal transporter complement.
6408,870021L0,870021,1. eighteen crossbred wethers were allotted at random (six per treatment) to each of the following diets: (1) maize silage; (2) grass silage; and (3) chopped hay.
6409,870021L1,870021,after 6 months a single oral dose of d alpha [5 me 3h]tocopherol was given to each sheep on these three treatments.
6410,870021L2,870021,"2. blood plasma, rumen liquor and urine radioactivity were measured for 4 d and, at the end of this period, the animals were killed and tissue distribution of 3h was determined."
6411,870021L3,870021,3. maize silage generally contained less alpha tocopherol than grass silage or hay.
6412,870021L4,870021,tissue uptake of 3h was greater on maize silage than other diets.
6413,870021L5,870021,"4. in muscle, spleen and liver, tocopherol concentrations were lower in the maize silage than the grass silage fed animals."
6414,870021L6,870021,5. a tendency to higher uptake of radioactivity was recorded at all times in the plasma and its lipid extract of sheep fed on maize silage than those fed on grass silage or hay.
6415,870021L7,870021,6. urine clearance of radioactivity tended to be higher in animals fed on the maize silage than those fed on grass silage or hay.
6416,870021L8,870021,this difference of magnitude in urinary excretion was probably related to the rate of metabolism of the ingested radiotocopherol.
6417,16703270L0,16703270,the purpose of the study was to determine whether along and in combination melatonin (mlt) and pentoxifylline (ptx) exerted beneficial effects on histopathological changes and changes in oxidant and antioxidant systems in liver caused by ccl4 induced liver toxicity in mice.
6418,16703270L1,16703270,"mice were randomly divided into six groups: control, olive oil, toxicity, mlt, ptx, ptx+mlt."
6419,16703270L2,16703270,"mlt 10 mg/kg/day, ptx 50 mg/kg/day, and the same individual doses in mlt+ptx combination were given intraperitoneally to mice for 7 day."
6420,16703270L3,16703270,"ccl4 0.8 mg/kg/day was administered on the 4th, 5th, and 6th days of therapy in all groups except the control and olive oil groups."
6421,16703270L4,16703270,"in the toxicity group, increased concentrations of malondialdehyde (mda) and lipid hydroperoxides (looh) and decreased glutathione peroxidase (gsh px) and catalase (cat) activities were found compared to the control and olive oil groups (p < 0.05)."
6422,16703270L5,16703270,"compared to the toxicity group, both the ptx group and the ptx+mlt group had decreased mda and looh levels, whereas mlt reduced only looh levels (p < 0.01)."
6423,16703270L6,16703270,"mlt, ptx and mlt+ptx increased the gsh px and cat activities compared to the toxicity group (p < 0.05)."
6424,16703270L7,16703270,mlt increased cat activity compared to ptx and mlt+ptx (p < 0.05).
6425,16703270L8,16703270,superoxide dismutase enzyme activity did not change in any group (p < 0.05).
6426,16703270L9,16703270,"histopathologically, ballooning, degeneration, apoptosis, and bridging necrosis were seen in the toxicity group."
6427,16703270L10,16703270,"mlt, ptx and mlt+ptx decreased the apoptosis and bridging necrosis (p < 0.01), and ptx and mlt+ptx decreased balloon degeneration compared to the toxicity group (p < 0.01)."
6428,16703270L11,16703270,these results indicate that administration of ptx and mlt alone and in combination before onset of liver toxicity might prevent the oxidative damage by reducing oxidative stress and increasing antioxidant enzyme levels.
6429,10876017L0,10876017,experiments were designed to determine the subtype of k(+) channels activated by the nitrovasodilator 3 morpholinosydnonimine (sin 1) in smooth muscle cells of the rabbit and guinea pig carotid arteries.
6430,10876017L1,10876017,"membrane potential was recorded in isolated segments with intracellular microelectrode and k(+) currents in freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells, with the patch clamp technique."
6431,10876017L2,10876017,"in the guinea pig carotid artery, sin 1 caused a glibenclamide sensitive hyperpolarization."
6432,10876017L3,10876017,"the nitrovasodilator did not affect the whole cell k(+) current, but activated a glibenclamide sensitive k(+) current."
6433,10876017L4,10876017,"in the rabbit carotid artery, sin 1 induced only an iberiotoxin sensitive repolarization in phenylephrine depolarized tissue and in isolated cells, enhanced the activity of an iberiotoxin sensitive k(+) current."
6434,10876017L5,10876017,"these findings demonstrate that the population of k(+) channels activated by nitric oxide (no) is species dependent and support the conclusion that, in the guinea pig carotid artery, in contrast to the rabbit carotid artery, the release of no cannot account for the responses attributed to endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor (edhf)."
6435,23022298L0,23022298,convergent morphologies often arise due to similar selective pressures in independent lineages.
6436,23022298L1,23022298,it is poorly understood whether the same or different developmental genetic mechanisms underlie such convergence.
6437,23022298L2,23022298,"here we show that independent evolution of a reproductive trait, ovariole number, has resulted from changes in distinct developmental mechanisms, each of which may have a different underlying genetic basis in drosophila."
6438,23022298L3,23022298,"ovariole number in drosophila is species specific, highly variable, and largely under genetic control."
6439,23022298L4,23022298,convergent changes in drosophila ovariole number have evolved independently within and between species.
6440,23022298L5,23022298,"we previously showed that the number of a specific ovarian cell type, terminal filament (tf) cells, determines ovariole number."
6441,23022298L6,23022298,here we examine tf cell development in different drosophila lineages that independently evolved a significantly lower ovariole number than the d. melanogaster oregon r strain.
6442,23022298L7,23022298,"we show that in these drosophila lineages, reduction in ovariole number occurs primarily through variations in one of two different developmental mechanisms: (1) reduced number of somatic gonad precursors (sgp cells) specified during embryogenesis; or (2) alterations of somatic gonad cell morphogenesis and differentiation in larval life."
6443,23022298L8,23022298,"mutations in the d. melanogaster insulin receptor (inr) alter sgp cell number but not ovarian morphogenesis, while targeted loss of function of bric à brac 2 (bab2) affects morphogenesis without changing sgp cell number."
6444,23022298L9,23022298,"thus, evolution can produce similar ovariole numbers through distinct developmental mechanisms, likely controlled by different genetic mechanisms."
6445,18302748L0,18302748,few genome scale models of organisms focus on the regulatory networks and none of them integrates all known levels of regulation.
6446,18302748L1,18302748,"in particular, the regulations involving metabolite pools are often neglected."
6447,18302748L2,18302748,"however, metabolite pools link the metabolic to the genetic network through genetic regulations, including those involving effectors of transcription factors or riboswitches."
6448,18302748L3,18302748,"consequently, they play pivotal roles in the global organization of the genetic and metabolic regulatory networks."
6449,18302748L4,18302748,"we report the manually curated reconstruction of the genetic and metabolic regulatory networks of the central metabolism of bacillus subtilis (transcriptional, translational and post translational regulations and modulation of enzymatic activities)."
6450,18302748L5,18302748,we provide a systematic graphic representation of regulations of each metabolic pathway based on the central role of metabolites in regulation.
6451,18302748L6,18302748,"we show that the complex regulatory network of b. subtilis can be decomposed as sets of locally regulated modules, which are coordinated by global regulators."
6452,18302748L7,18302748,this work reveals the strong involvement of metabolite pools in the general regulation of the metabolic network.
6453,18302748L8,18302748,breaking the metabolic network down into modules based on the control of metabolite pools reveals the functional organization of the genetic and metabolic regulatory networks of b. subtilis.

6456,26151763L2,26151763,a total of nine placentas from normal healthy pregnant females at full term were investigated.
6457,26151763L3,26151763,"reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed."
6458,26151763L4,26151763,the expression of nephrin mrna was relatively increased in the chorion compared with that in the villi and the amnion.
6459,26151763L5,26151763,the nephrin gene was detected in the villous cytotrophoblast cells and the endothelium of the intravillous vessels.
6460,26151763L6,26151763,"it was also present in the chorionic and amniotic membranous lining, with its distribution being particularly dense in the amniocytes."
6461,26151763L7,26151763,"the identification of nephrin in the human placenta, particularly at the maternal‑fetal interface, provides a novel insight into the molecular basis of the selective permeability of the placental barrier, which requires further elucidation."
6462,15088107L0,15088107,"coronary artery disease (cad) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, and cigarette smoking is a major contributing factor to the disease."
6463,15088107L1,15088107,glutathione s transferase (gst) enzyme is implicated in the detoxification of carcinogens present in tobacco smoke and consequent polymorphisms in this gene may confer susceptibility to cardiovascular disease if dna damage is important in cad.
6464,15088107L2,15088107,"therefore, we examined this question in a case control study of subjects having coronary atheroma by angiography and with a past history of myocardial infarction (mi)."
6465,15088107L3,15088107,the study population consists of 247 healthy controls and 148 consecutive patients who had undergone coronary angiography for suspicion of coronary artery disease.
6466,15088107L4,15088107,"dna was extracted from whole blood, and the gstm1 and gstt1 polymorphisms were determined using a real time polymerase chain reaction (pcr)."
6467,15088107L5,15088107,"we found that the null gstm1 and gstt1 genotypes were associated with an increase in the risk of developing coronary heart disease (or = 1.14; 95% ci: 0.71   1.82; or = 1.38; 95% ci: 0.82   2.32), respectively, but this increase was not significant."
6468,15088107L6,15088107,patients who smoke having the null genotypes of gstm1 (or: 1.63 (1.10   2.63)) and gstt1 (2.66 (1.50   4.72)) and both (3.20 (1.37   7.45)) were at a higher risk for developing coronary heart disease.

6475,8246009L2,8246009,no dna deletion was detected in both patients.
6476,8246009L3,8246009,dystrophin analysis through immunofluorescence and western blotting showed a negative pattern in the youngest patient and a positive one in the oldest.
6477,8246009L4,8246009,"apparently, this is the first report on intrafamilial variability in dystrophin abundance correlated with a difference in the severity of the phenotype."
6478,16652288L0,16652288,"the cc chemokine ligand 2 (ccl2) and cc chemokine receptor 2 (ccr2) are expressed in the heart after infection with trypanosoma cruzi, suggesting that they play an important role in host defense."
6479,16652288L1,16652288,"infection of ccr2 deficient (ccr2( / )) mice with t. cruzi resulted in increased cardiac parasitism, yet the severity of cardiac inflammation was not affected."

6481,16652288L3,16652288,these observations reveal that ccr2 signaling plays a distinct role that is separate from that of influencing either chemotaxis or previously defined anti trypomastigote mechanisms for the control of t. cruzi's replication in the heart.
6482,10571986L0,10571986,plant lipid transfer proteins (ltps) are soluble proteins which are characterized by their in vitro ability to transfer phospholipids between two membranes.
6483,10571986L1,10571986,"we have compared the functional properties of two ltps purified from maize and wheat seeds knowing that, despite a high degree of sequence identity, the two proteins exhibit structural differences."
6484,10571986L2,10571986,"it was found that wheat ltp had a lower transfer activity than the maize ltp, consistent with a lower kinetics of fatty acid binding."
6485,10571986L3,10571986,"the lower affinity for the fatty acids of the wheat ltp could be explained by a narrowing occurring in the middle part of the binding site, as revealed by comparing the fluorescence spectra of various anthroyloxy labeled fatty acids associated with the two ltps."
6486,10571986L4,10571986,the affinity for some natural fatty acids was studied by competition with fluorescent fatty acids toward binding to the protein.
6487,10571986L5,10571986,"again, wheat ltp had a lower affinity for those molecules."
6488,10571986L6,10571986,"all together, these observations reveal the complexity of the ltp family in plants, probably reflecting the multiple roles played by these proteins."

6492,16712938L3,16712938,the differential shifts for the six backbone amides that hydrogen bond to the metal coordinated sulfurs indicate that the pseudo 2 fold symmetry of the active site is more closely maintained in the hyperthermophile pf rubredoxin than in its mesophile cp homolog.
6493,16712938L4,16712938,these three metal substitutions form an isoelectronic series of small diamagnetic proteins for which reference structures are known to 1a resolution.
6494,16712938L5,16712938,these series provide a promising system to analyze theoretical predictions of the effects of differential charge distribution on chemical shifts from both proximal and long range interactions.

6503,3718986L0,3718986,"because the ability of cells to replace oxidized fatty acids in membrane phospholipids via deacylation and reacylation in situ may be an important determinant of the ability of cells to tolerate oxidative stress, incorporation of exogenous fatty acid into phospholipid by human erythrocytes has been examined following exposure of the cells to t butyl hydroperoxide."
6504,3718986L1,3718986,"exposure of human erythrocytes to t butyl hydroperoxide (0.5 1.0 mm) results in oxidation of glutathione, formation of malonyldialdehyde, and oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin."
6505,3718986L2,3718986,"under these conditions, incorporation of exogenous [9,10 3h]oleic acid into phosphatidylethanolamine is enhanced while incorporation of [9,10 3h]oleic acid into phosphatidylcholine is decreased."
6506,3718986L3,3718986,"these effects of t butyl hydroperoxide on [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation are not affected by dissipating transmembrane gradients for calcium and potassium."
6507,3718986L4,3718986,"when malonyldialdehyde production is inhibited by addition of ascorbic acid, t butyl hydroperoxide still decreases [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation into phosphatidylcholine but no stimulation of [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine occurs."
6508,3718986L5,3718986,"in cells pre treated with nano2 to convert hemoglobin to methemoglobin, t butyl hydroperoxide reduces [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation into phosphatidylcholine by erythrocytes but does not stimulate [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine."
6509,3718986L6,3718986,under these conditions oxidation of erythrocyte glutathione and formation of malonyldialdehyde still occur.
6510,3718986L7,3718986,these results indicate that membrane phospholipid fatty acid turnover is altered under conditions where peroxidation of membrane phospholipid fatty acids occurs and suggest that the oxidation state of hemoglobin influences this response.
6511,9213430L0,9213430,"the individual activities for adenosine kinase, deoxyadenosine kinase, adenosine deaminase, deoxyguanosine kinase, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase were determined during days 7 to 13 of mouse embryonic development."
6512,9213430L1,9213430,adenosine deaminase increased 74 fold between days 7 and 9; deoxyadenosine kinase increased 5.4 fold during the same interval.
6513,9213430L2,9213430,"adenosine kinase, deoxyguanosine kinase, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase exhibited less than 2 fold changes in activity between days 7 and 13. using michaelis constants for each enzyme and the maximal velocities determined from enzyme assay, the relative routes of adenosine and deoxyadenosine metabolism via phosphorylation or deamination were modeled as a function of nucleoside concentration for days 7 through 13. for days 7 and 8, phosphorylation of adenosine is the principle route of metabolism at physiological concentrations."
6514,9213430L3,9213430,a switch occurred at day 9 and following where deamination is at least 5 fold greater than phosphorylation at all substrate concentrations.
6515,9213430L4,9213430,deoxyadenosine phosphorylation was at most 10% of deamination at day 7 and then declined to less than 1% for days 9 to 13. phosphorolysis was the principle route of deoxyguanosine metabolism through the 7 to 13 day period.
6516,9213430L5,9213430,thus catabolism rather than phosphorylation was the principle pathway for purine deoxynucleoside metabolism during this period.

6518,8728645L1,8728645,these structures all form circular assemblies in which the individual subunits are related by rotational symmetry.
6519,8728645L2,8728645,in most cases the circular organization generates a new biophysical property and a specific biological function which have presumably been selected by evolution.
6520,17008598L0,17008598,environmental factors are considered key determinants of cardiovascular disease.
6521,17008598L1,17008598,"although lifestyle choices such as smoking, diet, and exercise are viewed as major environmental influences, the contribution of pollutants and environmental chemicals is less clear."
6522,17008598L2,17008598,accumulating evidence suggests that exposure to pollutants and chemicals could elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease.
6523,17008598L3,17008598,many epidemiological studies report that exposure to fine particles present in ambient air is associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality.
6524,17008598L4,17008598,"statistically significant relationships between particulate air pollution and ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and heart failure have been reported."
6525,17008598L5,17008598,animal studies show that exposure to ambient air particles increases peripheral thrombosis and atherosclerotic lesion formation.
6526,17008598L6,17008598,"exposures to arsenic, lead, cadmium, pollutant gases, solvents, and pesticides have also been linked to increased incidence of cardiovascular disease."
6527,17008598L7,17008598,"mechanistically, these effects have been attributed to changes in the synthesis or reactivity of nitric oxide that may be caused by environmental oxidants or increased endogenous production of reactive oxygen species."
6528,17008598L8,17008598,"additional studies are urgently needed to: identify the contribution of individual pollutants to specific aspects of cardiovascular disease; establish causality; elucidate the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms; estimate the relative susceptibility of diseased and healthy individuals and that of specific population groups; and determine whether pollutant exposure are risk correlates, that is, whether they influence major risk factors, such as hypertension, cholesterol, or diabetes, or whether they contribute to the absolute risk of heart disease."
6529,17008598L9,17008598,"collectively, these investigations could contribute to the emergent field of environmental cardiology."
6530,15492000L0,15492000,regulation of cell cell communication by the gap junction protein connexin43 can be modulated by a variety of connexin associating proteins.
6531,15492000L1,15492000,"in particular, c src can disrupt the connexin43 (cx43) zonula occludens 1 (zo 1) interaction, leading to down regulation of gap junction intercellular communication."
6532,15492000L2,15492000,"the binding sites for zo 1 and c src correspond to widely separated cx43 domains (approximately 100 residues apart); however, little is known about the structural modifications that may allow information to be transferred over this distance."
6533,15492000L3,15492000,"here, we have characterized the structure of the connexin43 carboxyl terminal domain (cx43ct) to assess its ability to interact with domains from zo 1 and c src."
6534,15492000L4,15492000,"nmr data indicate that the cx43ct exists primarily as an elongated random coil, with two regions of alpha helical structure."
6535,15492000L5,15492000,"nmr titration experiments determined that the zo 1 pdz 2 domain affected the last 19 cx43ct residues, a region larger than that reported to be required for cx43ct zo 1 binding."
6536,15492000L6,15492000,"the c src sh3 domain affected cx43ct residues lys 264 lys 287, ser 306 glu 316, his 331 phe 337, leu 356 val 359, and ala 367 ser 372. only region lys 264 lys 287 contains the residues previously reported to act as an sh3 binding domain."
6537,15492000L7,15492000,the specificity of these interactions was verified by peptide competition experiments.
6538,15492000L8,15492000,"finally, we demonstrated that the sh3 domain could partially displace the cx43ct pdz 2 complex."
6539,15492000L9,15492000,these studies represent the first structural characterization of a connexin domain when integrated in a multimolecular complex.
6540,15492000L10,15492000,"furthermore, we demonstrate that the structural characteristics of a disordered cx43ct are advantageous for signaling between different binding partners that may be important in describing the mechanism of channel closure or internalization in response to pathophysiological stimuli."
6541,23645671L0,23645671,the control of mrna biogenesis is exerted at several steps.
6542,23645671L1,23645671,"in response to extracellular stimuli, stress activated protein kinases (sapk) modulate gene expression to maximize cell survival."
6543,23645671L2,23645671,"in yeast, the hog1 sapk plays a key role in reprogramming the gene expression pattern required for cell survival upon osmostress by acting during transcriptional initiation and elongation."
6544,23645671L3,23645671,"here, we genetically show that an intact nuclear pore complex is important for cell survival and maximal expression of stress responsive genes."
6545,23645671L4,23645671,"the hog1 sapk associates with nuclear pore complex components and directly phosphorylates the nup1, nup2, and nup60 components of the inner nuclear basket."
6546,23645671L5,23645671,mutation of those factors resulted in a deficient export of stress responsive genes upon stress.
6547,23645671L6,23645671,"association of nup1, nup2, and nup60 to stress responsive promoters occurs upon stress depending on hog1 activity."
6548,23645671L7,23645671,"accordingly, stl1 gene territory is maintained at the nuclear periphery upon osmostress in a hog1 dependent manner."
6549,23645671L8,23645671,cells containing non phosphorylatable mutants in nup1 or nup2 display reduced expression of stress responsive genes.
6550,23645671L9,23645671,"together, proper mrna biogenesis of stress responsive genes requires of the coordinate action of synthesis and export machineries by the hog1 sapk."
6551,10873779L0,10873779,"recently, inflammatory mediators such as tnfalpha were identified as triggering active human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection."
6552,10873779L1,10873779,"here, we demonstrate that a highly stressful event in the absence of systemic inflammation, as observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction, leads to the development of an active hcmv infection in latently infected patients."
6553,10873779L2,10873779,"elucidating the molecular mechanism of virus activation, we could show that catecholamines directly stimulate the hcmv immediate early (ie) enhancer/promoter in monocytic cells via beta 2 adrenergic receptors."
6554,10873779L3,10873779,subsequent activation of the camp/pk a signaling pathway results in enhanced synthesis and binding of the transcription factor creb 1/atf 1 to the camp responsive elements within the ie enhancer.
6555,10873779L4,10873779,epinephrine also enhanced hcmv gene expression in infected thp 1 cells by about 50% in three of four experiments.
6556,10873779L5,10873779,"these data suggest that hcmv, like hsv 1 and vzv, can be (re)activated under stress conditions."

6559,28218778L2,28218778,"we then identified 96 glk1 family members from 53 species using a hidden markov model (hmm) search and found 24 of these genes, which were derived from 17 brassicaceae species."
6560,28218778L3,28218778,"phylogenetic analysis showed that 24 brassicaceae proteins were classified into three subgroups, named the brassica family, adenium arabicum, and arabidopsis."
6561,28218778L4,28218778,"using homologous cloning methods, we identified four bnaglk1 copies; however, the coding sequences were shorter than the putative sequences from the reference genome, probably due to splicing errors among the reference genome sequence or different gene copies being present in the different b. napus lines."
6562,28218778L5,28218778,"in addition, we found that bnaglk1 genes were expressed at higher levels in leaves with more chloroplasts than were present in other leaves."
6563,28218778L6,28218778,"overexpression of bnaglk1a resulted in darker leaves and siliques than observed in the control, suggesting that bnaglk1 might promote chloroplast development to affect the rate of photosynthesis in leaves."
6564,28218778L7,28218778,these results will help to elucidate the mechanism of chloroplast biogenesis by glk1 in b. napus.
6565,17277173L0,17277173,candida albicans expresses specific virulence traits that promote disease establishment and progression.
6566,17277173L1,17277173,these traits include morphological transitions between yeast and hyphal growth forms that are thought to contribute to dissemination and invasion and cell surface adhesins that promote attachment to the host.
6567,17277173L2,17277173,"here, we describe the regulation of the adhesin gene als3, which is expressed specifically during hyphal development in c. albicans."
6568,17277173L3,17277173,"using a combination of reporter constructs and regulatory mutants, we show that this regulation is mediated by multiple factors at the transcriptional level."
6569,17277173L4,17277173,"the analysis of als3 promoter deletions revealed that this promoter contains two activation regions: one is essential for activation during hyphal development, while the second increases the amplitude of this activation."
6570,17277173L5,17277173,further deletion analyses using the renilla reniformis luciferase reporter delineate the essential activation region between positions  471 and  321 of the promoter.
6571,17277173L6,17277173,further 5' or 3' deletions block activation.
6572,17277173L7,17277173,"als3 transcription is repressed mainly by nrg1 and tup1, but rfg1 contributes to this repression."
6573,17277173L8,17277173,"efg1, tec1, and bcr1 are essential for the transcriptional activation of als3, with tec1 mediating its effects indirectly through bcr1 rather than through the putative tec1 sites in the als3 promoter."
6574,17277173L9,17277173,"als3 transcription is not affected by cph2, but cph1 contributes to full als3 activation."
6575,17277173L10,17277173,the data suggest that multiple morphogenetic signaling pathways operate through the promoter of this adhesin gene to mediate its developmental regulation in this major fungal pathogen.
6576,23052027L0,23052027,nowadays it is possible to assess airway inflammation by measuring the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (feno) during an office visit and there is international consensus on the testing methodology.
6577,23052027L1,23052027,the aim of this study was to evaluate whether feno measurement may be a predictor of bronchial hyperreactivity (bhr) in patients with allergic rhinitis (ar).
6578,23052027L2,23052027,"two hundred eleven patients (196 males, median age 28.5 years) suffering from persistent ar were evaluated."
6579,23052027L3,23052027,"values for bronchial function (fvc, fev(1), and fef(25 75)), bronchial provocation tests (methacholine), exhaled nitric oxide (feno), a visual analogue scale for nasal and bronchial symptoms, and sensitization were assessed."
6580,23052027L4,23052027,a strong and inverse correlation between feno levels and bhr severity was found (r =  0.58).
6581,23052027L5,23052027,"feno was a predictive factor for bhr, and 37 ppb was found to be the best cutoff (area under the curve 0.90) to define the presence of bhr in patients with ar."
6582,23052027L6,23052027,this study highlights the relevance of feno as a possible predictive marker for bhr in ar patients and underlines the close link between upper and lower airways.
6583,23052027L7,23052027,"thus, feno measurement could be a useful screening tool in identifying subjects with rhinitis at risk of developing asthma."
6584,10634389L0,10634389,c reactive protein and homocysteine are independent risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease.
6585,10634389L1,10634389,this study compared the effects of hormone replacement therapy (hrt) and raloxifene on serum c reactive protein and homocysteine levels as markers of cardiovascular risk in healthy postmenopausal women.
6586,10634389L2,10634389,"healthy postmenopausal women (n = 390) were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, 6 month trial at eight out patient sites in the united states."
6587,10634389L3,10634389,"women were randomly assigned to receive continuous combined hrt (0.625 mg/day conjugated equine estrogen and 2.5 mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate), raloxifene (60 or 120 mg/day), or placebo for 6 months."
6588,10634389L4,10634389,c reactive protein and homocysteine were measured in baseline and 6 month serum samples.
6589,10634389L5,10634389,"hrt increased c reactive protein levels by 84% (p<0.001), whereas raloxifene (60 and 120 mg/day) had no significant effect ( 6% and  4%;, respectively; p>0.2)."
6590,10634389L6,10634389,"raloxifene (60 and 120 mg/day) significantly lowered serum levels ofhomocysteine by 8% (p = 0.014) and 6% (p = 0.024), respectively, similar to the 7% (p = 0.014) reduction obtained with hrt."
6591,10634389L7,10634389,we conclude that hrt and raloxifene lower serum homocysteine levels to a comparable extent in postmenopausal women.
6592,10634389L8,10634389,"whereas cardiovascular risk predicted by c reactive protein in healthy postmenopausal women is not influenced by raloxifene, the relationship between elevated c reactive protein levels with hrt and cardiovascular disease events requires further study."

6594,29327227L1,29327227,plant infecting caulimoviruses have evolved multiple regulatory mechanisms to address various environmental stimuli during the course of evolution.
6595,29327227L2,29327227,one such mechanism involves the retention of discrete stress responsive cis elements which are required for their survival and host specificity.
6596,29327227L3,29327227,"here we describe the characterization of a novel caulimoviral promoter isolated from horseradish latent virus (hrlv) and its regulation by multiple stress responsive transcription factors (tfs) namely dreb1, areb1 and tga1a."
6597,29327227L4,29327227,the activity of full length transcript (flt ) promoter from hrlv (  677 to + 283) was investigated in both transient and transgenic assays where we identified h12 (  427 to + 73) as the highest expressing fragment having ~ 2.5 fold stronger activity than the camv35s promoter.
6598,29327227L5,29327227,the h12 promoter was highly active and near constitutive in the vegetative and reproductive parts of both tobacco and arabidopsis transgenic plants.
6599,29327227L6,29327227,"interestingly, h12 contains a distinct cluster of cis elements like dehydration responsive element (dre core; gccgac), an aba responsive element (abre; acgtgtc) and as 1 element (tgacg) which are known to be induced by cold, drought and pathogen/sa respectively."
6600,29327227L7,29327227,"the specific binding of dreb1, areb1 and tga1a to dre, abre and as 1 elements respectively were confirmed by the gel binding assays using h12 promoter specific probes."
6601,29327227L8,29327227,detailed mutational analysis of the h12 promoter suggested that the presence of dre core and as 1 element was indispensable for its activity which was further confirmed by the transactivation assays.
6602,29327227L9,29327227,our studies imply that h12 could be a valuable genetic tool for regulated transgene expression under diverse environmental conditions.

6609,11588331L6,11588331,hippocampal ca1 neurons underwent dna fragmented cell death 3 days after 5 minutes of ischemia.
6610,11588331L7,11588331,"however, these neurons showed a strong tolerance to 5 minutes of ischemia 1 to 3 days after ischemic preconditioning."
6611,11588331L8,11588331,"immunohistochemistry showed virtually no constitutive expression of ku proteins in ca1 neurons; however, ischemic preconditioning induced neuronal ku 70 expression 1 to 3 days later."
6612,11588331L9,11588331,western blot confirmed an increase in ku 70 in this region at the same time.
6613,11588331L10,11588331,"the temporal and spatial expression of ku 70 corresponded to tolerance of the hippocampal ca1 neurons to subsequent ischemia, suggesting the involvement of ku proteins in the development of neuronal tolerance after ischemic preconditioning."
6614,8099375L0,8099375,"exposure of molt 3 human leukemic cells in culture to a lipophilic antifolate, trimetrexate (tmq), resulted in the development of sublines resistant to antifolates as well as to drugs related to multidrug resistance."
6615,8099375L1,8099375,the tmq resistant sublines had an increase in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) activity and overexpression of p glycoprotein.
6616,8099375L2,8099375,"in these sublines, neither the dhfr gene nor the mdr1 gene were amplified."
6617,8099375L3,8099375,"in these cells, dhfr transcripts were also not overexpressed but dhfr protein was increased, indicative of translational or post translational control of dhfr activity."
6618,8099375L4,8099375,"in contrast, mdr1 transcripts were found to be overexpressed, in parallel with p glycoprotein production."
6619,8099375L5,8099375,"therefore, increases in p glycoprotein appear controlled at the transcriptional level."
6620,8099375L6,8099375,these data support evidence that tmq produced two phenotypic changes independently: the former probably from folate deficiency and the latter from the lipophilic nature of the compound.

6640,2110532L0,2110532,"bovine rod outer segment (ros) membranes contain in addition to the heterotrimeric g protein transducin, several small gtp binding proteins (23 27 kda)."
6641,2110532L1,2110532,"furthermore, these membranes contain two substrate proteins (about 22 and 24 kda) for botulinum c3 adp ribosyltransferase known to adp ribosylate small g proteins in any mammalian cell type studied so far."
6642,2110532L2,2110532,"most interestingly, [32p]adp ribosylation of ros membrane small g proteins by c3 is regulated by light and guanine nucleotides in a manner similar to pertussis toxin catalyzed [32p]adp ribosylation of the alpha subunit of transducin."
6643,2110532L3,2110532,these findings suggest that not only the heterotrimeric g protein transducin but also the c3 substrate small g proteins present in ros membranes interact with photoexcited rhodopsin and thus contribute to its signalling action.
6644,2565200L0,2565200,the effect of methoxyflurane anesthesia on allyl alcohol induced hepatotoxicity and the metabolism of allyl alcohol was studied in male rats.
6645,2565200L1,2565200,hepatotoxicity was assessed by the measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase activity and histopathological examination.
6646,2565200L2,2565200,allyl alcohol induced hepatotoxicity was enhanced when allyl alcohol (32 mg/kg) was administered 4 hr before or up to 8 days after a single 10 min exposure to methoxyflurane vapors.
6647,2565200L3,2565200,"the possibility that methoxyflurane increases alcohol dehydrogenase dependent oxidation of allyl alcohol to acrolein, the proposed toxic metabolite, was evaluated by measuring the rate of acrolein formation in the presence of allyl alcohol and liver cytosol."
6648,2565200L4,2565200,the effect of methoxyflurane on alcohol dehydrogenase activity in liver cytosol was also assessed by measuring the rate of nad+ utilization in the presence of ethyl alcohol or allyl alcohol.
6649,2565200L5,2565200,alcohol dehydrogenase activity and rate of acrolein formation were elevated in methoxyflurane pretreated rats.
6650,2565200L6,2565200,the results suggest that a modest increase in alcohol dehydrogenase activity and rate of acrolein formation markedly enhances allyl alcohol induced hepatotoxicity.
6651,19805107L0,19805107,elevated expression of hsp90 is observed in many tumor types and is associated with a limited clinical response.
6652,19805107L1,19805107,"targeting hsp90 using inhibitors such as 17 dmag (17 desmethoxy 17 n,n dimethylaminoethylaminogeldanamycin) has shown limited therapeutic success."
6653,19805107L2,19805107,hsp90 regulates the function of several proteins implicated in tumorigenesis although the precise mechanism through which 17 dmag regulates tumor cell survival remains unclear.
6654,19805107L3,19805107,we observed a requirement for p53 in mediating 17 dmag induced cell death.
6655,19805107L4,19805107,the sensitivity of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and tumor cells to 17 dmag induced apoptosis depended on the p53 status.
6656,19805107L5,19805107,"wild type mefs underwent 17 dmag induced caspase dependent cell death, whilst those lacking p53 failed to do so."
6657,19805107L6,19805107,interestingly p53 dependent cell death occurred independently of atm or arf.

6659,19805107L8,19805107,"strikingly, 17 dmag treatment in an allograft model of ptch1(+/ );ink4c( / ) but not p53(fl/fl);nestin cre(+); ink4c( / ) tumor cells prevented tumor growth in vivo."
6660,19805107L9,19805107,our data suggest that p53 status is a likely predictor of the sensitivity of tumors to 17 dmag.
6661,2825802L0,2825802,udpglucuronic acid and erythroascorbic acid were identified in extracts of the fungus neurospora crassa.
6662,2825802L1,2825802,"the concentrations of these two compounds are estimated, in growing wild type n. crassa, to be about 0.10 and 0.28 mumol/ml of cell water, respectively."
6663,2825802L2,2825802,"the pools of these two compounds are regulated by cyclic amp in neurospora, both being elevated in the cr 1, adenylate cyclase deficient mutant and both being lowered by exogenous cyclic amp."
6664,2825802L3,2825802,the pools of these two compounds are also elevated on nitrogen deprivation.
6665,2825802L4,2825802,the pools of a large number of other nucleotides are not influenced by cyclic amp.
6666,2825802L5,2825802,possible relationships between the metabolism of udpglucuronic acid and erythroascorbic acid are discussed.
6667,2825802L6,2825802,it was found that exogenous cyclic amp was much more effective in influencing cultures grown at 30 37 degrees c than those grown at 25 degrees c. we suggest that higher temperatures may render neurospora more permeable to a variety of different compounds.
6668,26216893L0,26216893,chronic proliferative dermatitis in mice (cpdm) is a spontaneous multiorgan inflammatory disorder with pathological hallmarks similar to atopic dermatitis and psoriasis in humans.
6669,26216893L1,26216893,"cpdm mice lack expression of shank associated rh domain interacting protein, an adaptor of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex, which acts in the nf κb pathway to promote inflammation and protect from apoptosis and necroptosis."
6670,26216893L2,26216893,"although skin inflammation in cpdm mice is driven by tnf  and ripk1 induced cell death, the contribution of initiating innate immunity sensors and additional inflammatory pathways remains poorly characterized."
6671,26216893L3,26216893,"in this article, we show that inflammasome signaling, including the expression and activation of the inflammatory caspase 1 and  11 and il 1 family cytokines, was highly upregulated in the skin of cpdm mice prior to overt disease onset."
6672,26216893L4,26216893,"genetic ablation of caspase 1 and  11 from cpdm mice significantly reduced skin inflammation and delayed disease onset, whereas systemic immunological disease persisted."
6673,26216893L5,26216893,"loss of nlrp3 also attenuated skin disease, albeit more variably."
6674,26216893L6,26216893,"strikingly, induction of apoptosis and necroptosis effectors was sharply decreased in the absence of caspase 1 and  11. these results position the inflammasome as an important initiating signal in skin disease pathogenesis and provide novel insights about inflammasome and cell death effector cross talk in the context of inflammatory diseases."
6675,14636595L0,14636595,"the transcription factor pacc, mediating regulation of gene expression by ambient ph in the genetically amenable fungus aspergillus nidulans, contains a three zinc finger dna binding domain (zf dbd) including a nuclear localisation signal (nls)."
6676,14636595L1,14636595,"we selected 38 novel mutations impairing pacc function, of which 21 missense mutations identify individual residues essential for zf dbd structure/function."
6677,14636595L2,14636595,"our functional analysis agrees with our previous conclusion that finger 1 does not bind dna and provides in vivo evidence that trp80 and trp116, located in the cys knuckles of adjacent zinc fingers, are critical for zf dbd structure/function."
6678,14636595L3,14636595,"in the finger 3 alpha helix, gln155 (+4) is specifically involved in contacting dna, while the major role of lys159 (+6) resides in the nuclear localisation of the protein."
6679,14636595L4,14636595,"in contrast, lys158 is essential for dna binding and for nuclear localisation."
6680,14636595L5,14636595,"as finger 3 suffices to drive nuclear localisation of green fluorescent protein, we conclude that it contains an nls including essential lys158 and lys159."
6681,14636595L6,14636595,"these residues are within an alpha helical basic sequence that is completely conserved amongst zinc fingers of the pacc/rim101 family and present in an identical position of the last finger alpha helix of drosophila cubitus interruptus, where it is also involved in nuclear localisation."
6682,14636595L7,14636595,we propose that pacc and gli/ci zf dbds belong to a subclass of these domains characterised by possession of a pair of conserved trp residues involved in the interaction between the two most n terminal fingers and the presence of an nls in the alpha helix of the most c terminal finger.
6683,14636595L8,14636595,loss of pacc nuclear localisation resulting from his142leu (beta strand) and phe151ser (hydrophobic core) substitutions in finger 3 suggests that its folding is required for nls function.
6684,14636595L9,14636595,"overlap of dna binding and nls may aid release of pacc from its cognate importer(s) upon nuclear translocation, as suggested for zinc binuclear cluster proteins."
6685,10942205L0,10942205,secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) isolated from flaxseed has antioxidant activity and has been shown to prevent hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis.
6686,10942205L1,10942205,"an investigation was made of the effects of sdg on the development of diabetes in diabetic prone biobreeding rats (bbdp rats), a model of human type i diabetes [insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm)] to determine if this type of diabetes is due to oxidative stress and if sdg can prevent the incidence of diabetes."
6687,10942205L2,10942205,"the rats were divided into three groups: group i, biobreeding normal rats (bbn rats) (n = 10); group ii, bbdp untreated (n = 11); and group iii, bbdp treated with sdg 22 mg/kg body wt, orally) (n = 14)."
6688,10942205L3,10942205,"oxidative stress was determined by measuring lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (mda) an index of level of reactive oxygen species in blood and pancreas; and pancreatic chemiluminescence (pancreatic cl), a measure of antioxidant reserve."
6689,10942205L4,10942205,incidence of diabetes was 72.7% in untreated and 21.4% in sdg treated group as determined by glycosuria and hyperglycemia.
6690,10942205L5,10942205,sdg prevented the development of diabetes by approximately 71%.
6691,10942205L6,10942205,development of diabetes was associated with an increase in serum and pancreatic mda and a decrease in antioxidant reserve.
6692,10942205L7,10942205,prevention in development of diabetes by sdg was associated with a decrease in serum and pancreatic mda and an increase in antioxidant reserve.
6693,10942205L8,10942205,these results suggest that iddm is mediated through oxidative stress and that sdg prevents the development of diabetes.
6694,27068538L0,27068538,cell migration is a fundamental feature of tumour metastasis and angiogenesis.
6695,27068538L1,27068538,"it is regulated by a variety of signalling molecules including h2o2 and ca(2+) here, we asked whether the h2o2 sensitive transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (trpm2) ca(2+) channel serves as a molecular link between h2o2 and ca(2+) h2o2 mediated activation of trpm2 channels induced filopodia formation, loss of actin stress fibres and disassembly of focal adhesions, leading to increased migration of hela and prostate cancer (pc) 3 cells."
6696,27068538L2,27068538,"activation of trpm2 channels, however, caused intracellular release of not only ca(2+) but also of zn(2+) intriguingly, elevation of intracellular zn(2+) faithfully reproduced all of the effects of h2o2, whereas ca(2+) showed opposite effects."
6697,27068538L3,27068538,"interestingly, h2o2 caused increased trafficking of zn(2+) enriched lysosomes to the leading edge of migrating cells, presumably to impart polarisation of zn(2+) location."
6698,27068538L4,27068538,"thus, our results indicate that a reciprocal interplay between ca(2+) and zn(2+) regulates actin remodelling and cell migration; they call for a revision of the current notion that implicates an exclusive role for ca(2+) in cell migration."
6699,9263996L0,9263996,the inadequate proliferative response of the visceral glomerular epithelial cell (gec) following injury in vivo may contribute to the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis in many forms of glomerular disease.
6700,9263996L1,9263996,"cell proliferation is ultimately controlled by cell cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclins that bind to cyclin dependent kinases (cdk), and the active complex formed is necessary for progression through the cell cycle."
6701,9263996L2,9263996,"by inhibiting cyclin cdk complexes, cyclin kinase inhibitors arrest the cell cycle and prevent proliferation."
6702,9263996L3,9263996,"to determine the mechanisms that may be responsible for the lack of gec proliferation in vivo, we examined gec expression of specific cell cycle proteins in normal rats and in the passive heymann nephritis (phn) model of membranous nephropathy, where the gec are the target of complement mediated injury."
6703,9263996L4,9263996,following antibody deposition and complement activation there was a marked up regulation in the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 in rats with phn.
6704,9263996L5,9263996,"by associating with cyclin a cdk2 complexes, p21 and p27 limited the kinase activity of cdk2."
6705,9263996L6,9263996,"giving bfgf to rats with phn was associated with an increase in gec mitosis and ploidy and a decrease in expression of p21, but not cdk2 or p27."
6706,9263996L7,9263996,"furthermore, apoptosis was not present in phn, but was increased in rats given bfgf."
6707,9263996L8,9263996,"in conclusion, this study shows that the low proliferative capacity of the gec in vivo in response to immune injury may be due to an increase in the expression of specific cyclin kinase inhibitors."
6708,9263996L9,9263996,the increase in mitosis in phn rats given bfgf may be due to a decrease in p21.
6709,9263996L10,9263996,"thus, changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins may regulate the response of gec to injury and underlie the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis in diseases of the gec."
6710,16007192L0,16007192,"the paediatric eye tumour retinoblastoma is initiated by inactivation of rb1, a tumour suppressor on chromosome 13q."
6711,16007192L1,16007192,"in addition to rb1 loss, many retinoblastomas show other genetic alterations including gains on chromosomes 6p21 pter and 1q31 q32."
6712,16007192L2,16007192,"recently, the minimal region of gains on chromosome 6 was narrowed to band p22."
6713,16007192L3,16007192,we examined genomic gains and expression changes in primary retinoblastomas to identify potential target genes in 6p22.
6714,16007192L4,16007192,quantitative multiplex pcr detected copy numbers > or = 3 in 25 (33%) tumours and no gains in 31 of 76 (40%) tumours.
6715,16007192L5,16007192,"the remaining 20 (26%) samples showed gains only at some loci, most often including e2f3 and dek in 6p22.3."
6716,16007192L6,16007192,analysis of rna from 21 primary retinoblastomas showed that expression levels of these and some other genes in 6p22 correspond to dna gains.
6717,16007192L7,16007192,"however, kif 13a, a reported candidate oncogene on 6p, was expressed at low levels or absent."
6718,16007192L8,16007192,clinical manifestation of tumours with gains at all 6p22 loci was distinct in that distribution of age at diagnosis was markedly shifted to older age compared to tumours with no or partial gains.
6719,16007192L9,16007192,"in summary, our results suggest that dek and e2f3 are potential targets of 6p gains in retinoblastoma."
6720,2596737L0,2596737,repeated precordial ecg mapping (42 leads) and ck mb serum measurements were done in 40 patients with anterior and/or anterolateral acute myocardial infarction.

6722,2596737L2,2596737,"in 20 patients (the s group), randomly selected, a short term iv infusion of 1,500,000 iu streptokinase was administered and followed by the same anticoagulant treatment as in controls."
6723,2596737L3,2596737,ten subjects from each group underwent coronary arteriography one month later.
6724,2596737L4,2596737,from the analysis of ecg mapping the number of leads (n) and the sum of measurements (sigma) for each parameter were calculated.
6725,2596737L5,2596737,before treatment there were no significant differences for all measured parameters between the two groups of patients.
6726,2596737L6,2596737,"seven days later, st elevations were statistically different for nst and sigma st with lower values for the s group."

6728,2596737L8,2596737,no statistically significant difference was found for nq and sigma q. ck mb curve showed an earlier peak in the s group than in the control group.
6729,2596737L9,2596737,five patients from the s group showed a patency of the infarct related vessel.
6730,2596737L10,2596737,"in conclusion, the results of this study show that patients receiving s have a significant benefit with ecg improvement."
6731,2596737L11,2596737,"on the other hand, the ck mb curve indicates an eventual recanalization to a certain degree in the obstructed coronary artery, which is the final goal."
6732,11487564L0,11487564,"the rd7 mouse is a model for hereditary retinal degeneration characterized clinically by retinal spotting throughout the fundus and late onset retinal degeneration, and histologically by retinal dysplasia manifesting as folds and whorls in the photoreceptor layer."
6733,11487564L1,11487564,this study demonstrates that the rd7 phenotype results from a splicing error created by a genomic deletion of an intron and part of an exon.
6734,11487564L2,11487564,hematoxylin/eosin staining of rd7 tissue shows that the whorls in the outer nuclear layer of the retina do not appear during embryonic development but manifest by postnatal day 12.5 (p12.5).
6735,11487564L3,11487564,"furthermore, in situ hybridization data indicates that the nr2e3 message is first present at barely discernable levels at embryonic day 18.5, becomes abundant by p2.5, and reaches maximal adult levels by p10.5."
6736,11487564L4,11487564,results from these experiments indicate that nr2e3 message is expressed prior to the development of s cones.
6737,11487564L5,11487564,"this data coincides with studies in humans showing that mutations in nr2e3 result in a unique type of retinal degeneration known as enhanced s cone syndrome, where patients have a 30 fold increase in s cone sensitivity compared to normal."
6738,11487564L6,11487564,immunohistochemical staining of cone cells demonstrates that rd7 retinas have an increased number of cone cells compared to wild type retinas.
6739,11487564L7,11487564,"thus, nr2e3 may function by regulating genes involved in cone cell proliferation, and mutations in this gene lead to retinal dysplasia and degeneration by disrupting normal photoreceptor cell topography as well as cell cell interactions."

6741,12386120L1,12386120,"following a single oral dose of [(14)c]dpc with and without rtv pretreatment in rats, and subsequent analysis of whole body sections, prepared at 1 and 7 or 8 h postdose, using whole body autoradiography showed an increase in radioactivity in tissues (e.g., brain, and testes) upon coadministration."
6742,12386120L2,12386120,"the distribution of radioactivity in the brain parenchyma and ventricles was different, such that the concentration of radioactivity was greater in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) than in central nervous system."
6743,12386120L3,12386120,"thus, the use of csf concentration of the total radioactivity as a surrogate for brain penetration would result in an overestimation."
6744,12386120L4,12386120,dpc was determined to be metabolized prominently by rcyp3a4.
6745,12386120L5,12386120,the increased tissue exposure to dpc in rats could largely be attributed to inhibition of cyp3a1/2 by rtv.
6746,12386120L6,12386120,"dpc was also a good substrate for p glycoprotein (pgp), with k(m) of 4 microm and v(max) of 13 pmol/min."
6747,12386120L7,12386120,the pgp mediated transport of dpc across caco 2 cells was readily saturated at >or=10 microm and was inhibited significantly by rtv at 5 to 10 microm.
6748,12386120L8,12386120,the data above and the reported rtv concentrations suggested that both the pgp and cyp3a4 inhibition by rtv may play a significant role in enhancing the systemic and tissue exposure to dpc in humans.
6749,18403046L0,18403046,proteins of the nuclear envelope have been implicated as participating in gene silencing.
6750,18403046L1,18403046,"baf, a dna  and lem domain binding protein, has been suggested to link chromatin to the nuclear envelope."
6751,18403046L2,18403046,"we have previously shown that lap2beta, a lem domain inner nuclear membrane protein, represses transcription through binding to hdac3 and induction of histone h4 deacetylation."
6752,18403046L3,18403046,"we now show that lap2zeta, the smallest lap2 family member, is also involved in regulation of transcription."
6753,18403046L4,18403046,we show that similar to other lem domain proteins lap2zeta interacts with baf.
6754,18403046L5,18403046,"lap2zeta yfp and baf co localize in the cytoplasm, and overexpression of lap2zeta leads to reduction of nucleoplasmic baf."
6755,18403046L6,18403046,mutations in the lap2zeta yfp lem domain decrease its interaction with baf retaining the nucleo cytoplasmic distribution of baf.
6756,18403046L7,18403046,co expression of lap2beta and lap2zeta results in inhibition of lap2beta induced gene silencing while overexpression of lap2zeta alone leads to a small increase in transcriptional activity of various transcription factors.
6757,18403046L8,18403046,our results suggest that lap2zeta is a transcriptional regulator acting predominantly to inhibit lap2beta mediated repression.
6758,18403046L9,18403046,lap2zeta may function by decreasing availability of baf.
6759,18403046L10,18403046,these findings could have implications in the study of nuclear lamina associated diseases and baf dependent retroviral integration.
6760,16968693L0,16968693,translational pausing can lead to cleavage of the a site codon and facilitate recruitment of the transfer messenger rna (tmrna) (ssra) quality control system to distressed ribosomes.
6761,16968693L1,16968693,we asked whether aminoacyl trna binding site (a site) mrna cleavage occurs during regulatory translational pausing using the escherichia coli secm mediated ribosome arrest as a model.
6762,16968693L2,16968693,"we find that secm ribosome arrest does not elicit efficient a site cleavage, but instead allows degradation of downstream mrna to the 3' edge of the arrested ribosome."
6763,16968693L3,16968693,"characterization of secm arrested ribosomes shows the nascent peptide is covalently linked via glycine 165 to trna(3gly) in the peptidyl trna binding site, and prolyl trna(2pro) is bound to the a site."
6764,16968693L4,16968693,"although a site cleaved mrnas were not detected, tmrna mediated ssra tagging after secm glycine 165 was observed."
6765,16968693L5,16968693,"this tmrna activity results from sequestration of prolyl trna(2pro) on overexpressed secm arrested ribosomes, which produces a second population of stalled ribosomes with unoccupied a sites."
6766,16968693L6,16968693,"indeed, compensatory overexpression of trna(2pro) readily inhibits ssra tagging after glycine 165, but has no effect on the duration of secm ribosome arrest."
6767,16968693L7,16968693,"we conclude that, under physiological conditions, the architecture of secm arrested ribosomes allows regulated translational pausing without interference from a site cleavage or tmrna activities."
6768,16968693L8,16968693,"moreover, it seems likely that a site mrna cleavage is generally avoided or inhibited during regulated ribosome pauses."

6770,10322779L1,10322779,"we measured spectrophotometrically the plasma vitamin c(p vc), plasma vitamin e(p ve), plasma beta carotene (p beta car) contents and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (e sod), erythrocyte catalase (e cat), erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (e gsh px) activities in 194 male (40 years old) alcohol abusers and 50 male (40 years old) nondrinkers."
6771,10322779L2,10322779,"the average p vc, p ve, p beta car contents and e sod, e cat, e gsh px activities of the alcohol abuser group were lower than those of the nondrinker group."
6772,10322779L3,10322779,"the p vc, p ve, p beta car contents and e sod, e cat, e gsh px activities of the alcohol abusers decreased as the time and quantity of abusing alcohol increased."
6773,10322779L4,10322779,"the oxygen free radical reaction in the alcohol abusers was pathologically exacerbated, and the balance between oxidation and antioxidation was serious imbalanced."
6774,17483359L0,17483359,tumor necrosis factor (tnf) binds to two different receptors.
6775,17483359L1,17483359,"although most of its functions are attributed to tnf receptor 1 (tnfr1), the independent role of tnfr2 is still largely unknown."
6776,17483359L2,17483359,"using tnfr single or double knock out mice, we show here that the expression of tnfr2 alone on host cells was sufficient to suppress the growth of tnf secreting tumors in both immune competent and t/b lymphocyte deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mice."
6777,17483359L3,17483359,"histologic studies showed that tnf recruited, via tnfr2, large numbers of macrophages and efficiently inhibited angiogenesis in the tumor."
6778,17483359L4,17483359,"in vitro, tnf activated tnfr1 deficient macrophages to produce nitric oxide (no)."
6779,17483359L5,17483359,"treatment of tnfr1 knock out mice with l name, a specific no synthase inhibitor, almost completely eliminated tnf induced angiostasis and tumor suppression."
6780,17483359L6,17483359,"moreover, l name acted only during the first few days of tumor growth."
6781,17483359L7,17483359,"our results show for the first time that tnfr2 expressed on host innate immune cells is sufficient to mediate the antitumor effect of tnf, and no is necessary for this process, possibly by inhibition of angiogenesis in the tumor."

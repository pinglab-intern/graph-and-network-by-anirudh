0,"appl1 interacts with adiponectin receptors and other important signaling molecules. it contains a bar and a ph domain near its n terminus, and the two domains may function as a unit (bar ph domain). we report here the crystal structures of the bar ph and ptb domains of human appl1. the structures reveal novel features for bar domain dimerization and for the interactions between the bar and ph domains. the bar domain dimer of appl1 contains two four helical bundles, whereas other bar domain dimers have only three helices in each bundle. the ph domain is located at the opposite ends of the bar domain dimer. yeast two hybrid assays confirm the interactions between the bar and ph domains. lipid binding assays show that the bar, ph, and ptb domains can bind phospholipids. the ability of appl1 to interact with multiple signaling molecules and phospholipids supports an important role for this adaptor in cell signaling.",2007,17502098,Crystal structures of the BAR-PH and PTB domains of human APPL1.
1,"the gamma aminobutyrate type a receptor associated protein (gabarap) is a ubiquitin like modifier, and is implicated in a variety of membrane trafficking and fusion events that are crucial to synaptic plasticity, autophagy and apoptosis. however, important aspects of gabarap function and regulation remain poorly understood. we review the current state of knowledge about gabarap, highlighting newly identified gabarap ligands, and discuss the possible physiological relevance of each ligand interaction.",2009,19674112,Structure and potential function of gamma-aminobutyrate type A receptor-associated protein.

3,"there are two phases of somatic muscle formation in drosophila. during embryonic development, one phase of myogenesis generates larval muscle elements that mediate the relatively simple behavioural repertoire of the larva. during pupal metamorphosis, a diverse pattern of muscle fibres are assembled, and these facilitate the more elaborate behavioural patterns of the adult fly. in this review, we discuss the current status of understanding of the cellular, genetic, and molecular mechanisms of pattern formation during the second phase, imaginal muscle development. we briefly compare aspects of embryonic and adult myogenesis in drosophila and muscle development in vertebrates and highlight conserved themes and disparities between these diverse myogenic programmes.",1999,10402955,Muscle pattern diversification in Drosophila: the story of imaginal myogenesis.
4,"phenolic compounds were applied in a sausage formulation as a substitute for artificial sodium erythorbate used as antioxidant. five assays were prepared in which sodium erythorbate control at 0.05 g/100 g was replaced with a hydrosoluble mixture containing caffeic acid + carnosic acid (47% + 53%) and a liposoluble mixture containing quercetin + rutin (67% + 33%) in two final concentrations (0.05 g/100 g and 0.08 g/100 g). physico chemical, color, texture, and sensory parameters were measured on the first day and after 45 days of storage at 4 °c. all phenolic compound mixtures were able to maintain oxidative stability in the sausages when measured by the malondialdehyde concentration, which was expressed as tbars. the mixture containing quercetin + rutin at 0.05 g/100 g showed lower malondialdehyde formation after 45 days of storage, and no sensory differences from the sausage adopted as control.",2013,23014857,Effects of optimized mixtures containing phenolic compounds on the oxidative stability of sausages.
5,"we investigated the existence of an endogenous system for lactate transport in xenopus laevis oocytes. (36)cl uptake studies excluded the involvement of a dids sensitive anion antiporter as a possible pathway for lactate movement. l [(14)c]lactate uptake was unaffected by superimposed ph gradients, stimulated by the presence of na(+) in the incubating solution, and severely reduced by the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor p chloromercuribenzenesulphonate (pcmbs). transport exhibited a broad cation specificity and was cis inhibited by other monocarboxylates, mostly by pyruvate. these results suggest that lactate uptake is mediated mainly by a transporter and that the preferred anion is pyruvate. [(14)c]pyruvate uptake exhibited the same pattern of functional properties evidenced for l lactate. kinetic parameters were calculated for both monocarboxylates, and a higher affinity for pyruvate was revealed. various inhibitors of monocarboxylate transporters reduced significantly pyruvate uptake. these studies demonstrate that xenopus laevis oocytes possess a monocarboxylate transport system that shares some functional features with the members of the mammalian monocarboxylate cotransporters family, but, in the meanwhile, exhibits some particular properties, mainly concerning cation specificity.",2000,10801286,An endogenous monocarboxylate transport in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
6,"secretory granules from the rat pancreas contain electrolyte transport pathways that may contribute to exocrine fluid production. the cl  selective transport pathway was measured indirectly in isolated granules by ionophore induced lysis after suspension in isotonic kcl. this cl  transport was shown to respond to alterations in the granule membrane lipid environment. exogenously added phospholipase a2 (pla2) caused an increase of up to 193% in the cl  specific transport by the isolated granules. in addition, the products of pla2 hydrolysis, lysophospholipids and unesterified fatty acids, directly increased the rate of cl  transport when incubated with granules in vitro. lysophospholipids (2.0 micrograms/ml) increased the cl  transport between 280 450% (depending on the lysophospholipid species). similarly, free fatty acids (10 microm) increased the granule cl  transport from 25% with capric acid (10:0) to 255% with arachidonic acid (20:4). the relative extent of stimulation by fatty acids was dependent on their carbon chain length and to a lesser extent, the degree of unsaturation. the inhibition (68%) of pla2 promoted granule lysis by 4 acetamido 4' isothiocyanatostilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid (0.5 mm) also suggests that the effect is specific for the granule cl  channel. thus, the data show that zymogen granule cl  transport is influenced by membrane lipids and supports a role for pla2 in controlling electrolyte transport during stimulus secretion coupling.",1994,8075126,The effect of phospholipase A2 on chloride transport by pancreatic secretory granules.
7,"eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) has been shown to exert anti inflammatory actions. to evaluate the effects of epa on chronic hepatitis c, we administered epa ethyl ester capsules to patients receiving the combination therapy of interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin. epa (1,800 mg/d) was supplemented in combination with vitamin e (300 mg/d) and c (600 mg/d) to 5 chronic hepatitis c patients (epa group). five patients were administered vitamin e and c but not epa (control group). blood samples were obtained before and after 4, 8, 12 and 24 wk of therapy and analyzed for fatty acid compositions of erythrocyte and plasma and serum 8 hydroxy 2' deoxyguanosine. epa in erythrocyte membrane rose to 3 fold the basal level in the epa group, while it decreased significantly in the control group after 24 wk of therapy. lymphocyte counts in the epa group increased to 120.8 +/  25.4% after 4 wk of therapy and maintained the basal level throughout therapy, whereas the counts decreased significantly in controls. the serum alanine aminotransferase level was improved significantly in the epa group. changes in lymphocyte counts following 24 wk of therapy correlated with the epa level in erythrocyte. the serum 8 hydroxy 2' deoxyguanosine level at 24 wk in the epa group was significantly lower than that in controls. these observations may suggest the beneficial effect of epa supplementation in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c patients.",2005,16521701,Effects of eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C patients.
8,"age related macular degeneration (amd) is a slow, progressive disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors. free radical induced oxidation of docosahexaenoate (dha) containing lipids generates omega (2 carboxyethyl)pyrrole (cep) protein adducts that are more abundant in ocular tissues from amd than normal human donors. to understand better the role of oxidative damage in amd, we have synthesized cep modified proteins, produced anti cep antibodies, and initiated analysis of cep immunoreactivity and autoantibodies in human plasma. a highly selective rabbit polyclonal anti cep antibody was raised that binds cep 1000 times more strongly than carboxypropylpyrrole, a close structural analogue. the cep adduct uniquely indicates oxidative modification from dha derivatives because cep protein modifications cannot arise from any other common polyunsaturated fatty acid. immunocytochemistry localized cep to photoreceptor rod outer segments and retinal pigment epithelium in mouse retina and demonstrated more intense cep immunoreactivity in photoreceptors from a human amd donor compared with healthy human retina. the mean level of anti cep immunoreactivity in amd human plasma (n = 19 donors) was 1.5 fold higher (p = 0.004) than in age matched controls (n = 19 donors). sera from amd patients demonstrated mean titers of anti cep autoantibody 2.3 fold higher than controls (p = 0.02). of individuals (n = 13) exhibiting both antigen and autoantibody levels above the mean for non amd controls, 92% had amd. these results suggest that together cep immunoreactivity and autoantibody titer may have diagnostic utility in predicting amd susceptibility.",2003,12923198,"Carboxyethylpyrrole protein adducts and autoantibodies, biomarkers for age-related macular degeneration."
9,"metabolic abnormalities observed in retina and in cerebral cortex were compared in diabetic rats and experimentally galactosemic rats. diabetes or experimental galactosemia of 2 months duration significantly increased oxidative stress in retina, as shown by elevation of retinal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbars) and subnormal activities of antioxidant defense enzymes, but had no such effect in the cerebral cortex. activities of sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase [(na,k) atpase] and calcium atpase became subnormal in retina as well as in cerebral cortex. in contrast, protein kinase c (pkc) activity was elevated in retina but not in cerebral cortex in the same hyperglycemic rats. dietary supplementation with an antioxidant mixture (containing ascorbic acid, trolox, alpha tocopherol acetate, n acetyl cysteine, beta carotene, and selenium) prevented the diabetes induced and galactosemia induced elevation of retinal oxidative stress, the elevation of retinal pkc activity and the decrease of retinal atpases. in cerebral cortex, administration of the antioxidant diet also prevented the diabetes induced decreases in (na,k) atpase and calcium atpases, but had no effect on tbars and activities of pkc and antioxidant defense enzymes. the results indicate that retina and cerebral cortex differ distinctly in their response to elevation of tissue hexose, and that cerebral cortex is more resistant than retina to diabetes induced oxidative stress. the greater resistance to oxidative stress in cerebral cortex, as compared to retina, is consistent with the resistance of cerebral cortex to microvascular disease in diabetes, and with a hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to microvascular disease in diabetes. dietary supplementation with these antioxidants offers a means to inhibit multiple hyperglycemia induced retinal metabolic abnormalities.",1999,9895229,"Abnormalities of retinal metabolism in diabetes or experimental galactosemia.

10,"polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other inflammatory cells on exposure to appropriate stimuli release superoxide anion radical into the extracellular space. this results in the further generation of other activated oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. we have assessed the influence of activated oxygen species, generated by substrate xanthine oxidase systems, on the degradation of hyaluronic acid, human glial cells in culture and the microcirculation of the hamster cheek pouch. hyaluronic acid degradation was observed and morphological changes, culminating in cell death, were seen in glial cells. increased microvascular permeability and increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte endothelial adhesion were also observed. the results suggest that a variety of alterations to macromolecular and cellular elements of tissues can be mediated by specific free radical species. similar mechanisms may play a role in the structural and cellular injury occurring in the microcirculation during inflammation and other disease processes.",1980,6261530,Free radicals as mediators of tissue injury.

12,"osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk. the majority of oi cases have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are usually caused by mutations in genes encoding type i collagen. oi cases of autosomal recessive inheritance are rare, and oi type xi is attributable to mutation of the fkbp10 gene. here, we used next generation sequencing and sanger sequencing to detect mutations in fkbp10 and to analyze their relation to the phenotypes of oi type xi in three chinese patients. we also evaluated the efficacy of zoledronic acid treatment in these patients. two of the affected patients had novel compound heterozygous mutations, one patient with c.343c>t (p.r115x) in exon 2 and c.1085delc (p.a362fsx1) in exon 7, and the other patient with c.879c>g (p.y293x) in exon 5 and c.918 3c>g in intron 5. in the third proband, we identified a homozygous single base pair duplication, c.831dupc (p.g278rfsx95) in exon 5. in conclusion, we report for the first time that these novel pathogenic mutations of fkbp10 can lead to the extremely rare type xi oi without contractures, which expands the genotypic spectrum of oi. the phenotypes of these patients are similar to patients with types iii or iv oi, and zoledronic acid is effective in increasing bmd, inhibiting bone resorption biomarkers and reducing fractures of these patients.",2017,27762305,Novel mutations in FKBP10 in Chinese patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and their treatment with zoledronic acid.

14,"one of the microsomal carboxyesterases, carboxyesterase e1, was purified from rat liver to homogeneity. carboxyesterase e1 is a glycoprotein of high mannose type, and is composed of three identical subunits of 59 kda each. it is very similar to ""esterase pi 6.0"" described by menthein et al. (arch. biochem. biophys. 200, 547 559 (1980)) in molecular weight, amino acid composition, and enzymic activities. carboxyesterase e1 was found to be evenly distributed between rough and smooth microsomes. the content of the enzyme in microsomes was about 1.5% of total microsomal protein. it was exclusively located on the luminal side of microsomes, and was not detected immunologically in golgi fractions or serum. in vitro translation of rat liver rna by reticulocyte lysate showed that carboxyesterase e1 was synthesized preferentially on the bound ribosomes, as a precursor peptide larger than the peptide of the mature enzyme. carboxyesterase e1 was solubilized from microsomes by treatment with low concentrations of detergents. however, it was not released from microsomes by treatment with a synthetic peptide which made the microsomal membrane permeable to soluble protein molecules. carboxyesterase e1 is not a soluble luminal protein, and seems to be bound to the luminal surface of the membrane.",1988,3360755,Biosynthesis and localization of rat liver microsomal carboxyesterase E1.
15,"the bop gene (for cd8b opposite) is located immediately upstream of the mouse cd8b gene. expression of bop gene transcripts was previously observed in several long term ctl lines and in thymus. the present studies demonstrate that expression of the bop gene in lymphocytes appears to be confined to cd8 positive cells, and that bop gene expression is inducible by con a. they further show that a single bop gene encodes protein products with distinct amino terminal sequences that are expressed in ctls (t bop) and in cardiac and skeletal muscle (skm bop), as well as what appears to be a noncoding cdna (t ncb) expressed only in ctls. the t bop and t ncb cdnas in ctls result from alternative splicing of a single primary transcript, whereas the bop transcripts expressed in ctls and in muscle appear to be transcribed from different promoters. the bop proteins expressed in ctls and muscle contain zinc finger like motifs with homology to those of the eto/mtg8 proto oncogene and several other proteins of interest. western blot analysis with a hamster anti bop mab have detected the bop protein in muscle cells and in cos 7 cells transfected with bop cdna constructs.",1997,9013956,The Bop gene adjacent to the mouse CD8b gene encodes distinct zinc-finger proteins expressed in CTLs and in muscle.

17,"assembling protein complexes and protein interaction networks from affinity purification based proteomics data sets remains a challenge. when little a priori knowledge of the complexes exists, it is difficult to place proteins in the proper locations and evaluate the results of clustering approaches. here we have systematically compared multiple hierarchical and partitioning clustering approaches using a well characterized but highly complex human protein interaction network data set centered around the conserved aaa+ atpases tip49a and tip49b. this network provides a challenge to clustering algorithms because tip49a and tip49b are present in four distinct complexes, the network contains modules, and the network has multiple attachments. we compared the use of binary data, quantitative proteomics data in the form of normalized spectral abundance factors, and the z score normalization. in our analysis, a partitioning approach indicated the major modules in a network. next, while euclidian distance was sensitive to scaling, with data transformation, all the attachments in a data set were recovered in one branch of a dendrogram. finally, when pearson correlation and hierarchical clustering were used, complexes were well separated and their attachments were placed in the proper locations. each of these three approaches provided distinct information useful for assembly of a network of multiple protein complexes.",2009,19317493,Evaluation of clustering algorithms for protein complex and protein interaction network assembly.
18,"a full length tomato cdna clone, tsw12, which is developmentally and environmentally regulated, has been isolated and characterized. tsw12 mrna is accumulated during tomato seed germination and its level increases after nacl treatment or heat shock. in mature plants, tsw12 mrna is only detected upon treatment with nacl, mannitol or aba and its expression mainly occurs in stems. the nucleotide sequence of tsw12 includes an open reading frame coding for a basic protein of 114 amino acids; the first 23 amino acids exhibit the sequence characteristic of a signal peptide. the high similarity between the tsw12 deduced amino acid sequence and reported lipid transfer proteins suggests that tsw12 encodes a lipid transfer protein.",1992,1558948,A probable lipid transfer protein gene is induced by NaCl in stems of tomato plants.
19,"there is limited information on the absorption of selenium from different foods in humans because of technical difficulties associated with isotopic labeling of dietary selenium. wheat, garlic, and cod fish were intrinsically labeled with se 77 or se 82 stable isotopes. labeled meals were fed in random order to 14 adults, with a minimum washout period of six weeks between each test meal. apparent absorption was measured as luminal loss using a fecal monitoring technique over an 8 day period. plasma appearance of the isotope was measured at 7, 24, and 48 hours post ingestion. selenium absorption (+/  sd) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) from wheat (81.0 +/  3.0%) and garlic (78.4 +/  13.7%) than from fish (56.1 +/  4.3%). lowest plasma concentration was observed after the fish meal at all three time points, with a peak at 24 hours, whereas wheat produced the highest plasma concentration at all three time points and peaked at 7 hours. selenium absorption from wheat and garlic was higher than from fish, and inter individual variation was low. form of selenium and food constituents appear to be key determinants of post absorptive metabolism.",2005,16028633,"Absorption of selenium from wheat, garlic, and cod intrinsically labeled with Se-77 and Se-82 stable isotopes."
20,"excitation contraction (e c) coupling is thought to involve close interactions between the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor; ryr) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) and the dihydropyridine receptor (dhpr) alpha 1 subunit in the t tubule membrane. triadin, a 95 kd protein isolated from heavy sr, binds both the ryr and dhpr and may thus participate in e c coupling or in interactions responsible for the formation of sr/t tubule junctions. immunofluorescence labeling of normal mouse myotubes shows that the ryr and triadin co aggregate with the dhpr in punctate clusters upon formation of functional junctions. dysgenic myotubes with a deficiency in the alpha 1 subunit of the dhpr show reduced expression and clustering of ryr and triadin; however, both proteins are still capable of forming clusters and attaining mature cross striated distributions. thus, the molecular organization of the ryr and triadin in the terminal cisternae of sr as well as its association with the t tubules are independent of interactions with the dhpr alpha 1 subunit. analysis of calcium transients in dysgenic myotubes with fluorescent calcium indicators reveals spontaneous and caffeine induced calcium release from intracellular stores similar to those of normal muscle; however, depolarization induced calcium release is absent. thus, characteristic calcium release properties of the ryr do not require interactions with the dhpr; neither do they require the normal organization of the ryr in the terminal sr cisternae. in hybrids of dysgenic myotubes fused with normal cells, both action potential induced calcium transients and the normal clustered organization of the ryr are restored in regions expressing the dhpr alpha 1 subunit.",1993,8245124,Triad formation: organization and function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel and triadin in normal and dysgenic muscle in vitro.

24,"gene regulation by steroid hormones is mediated by binding of the hormone ligand to the corresponding receptor that triggers a complex set of interactions of the hormone receptors with each other, with dna in chromatin, and with a variety of other proteins. in this review we attempt to summarize what is known about these interactions using as the main example the regulation of mouse mammary tumor virus transcription by glucocorticoids and progestins. we describe in some detail the interaction of monomers and homodimers of the steroid receptors with their recognition sequences, and the molecular mechanism used to discriminate between the responsive elements for glucocorticoids/progestins and estrogens. we then review the interactions between homologous and heterologous hormone receptors on complex hormone regulatory regions, before devoting some attention to the synergistic and inhibitory interactions of hormone receptors with other transcription factors. finally we briefly summarize some of the possible mechanisms that modulate the molecular interactions of hormone receptors. in addition to ligand binding, these include receptor phosphorylation, changes in dna topology, and the organization of dna in nucleosomes. from this overview we draw the tentative conclusion that the specificity of the hormonal response in different cells results from a combination of developmental restrictions both in the accessibility of genomic sequence and in the repertoire of regulatory proteins present in each particular cell. in addition, the array of regulatory sequences in dna and chromatin determines the precise nature of macromolecular interactions of the receptors that are modulated by their degree of phosphorylation.",1993,8223341,Steroid hormone receptors: interaction with deoxyribonucleic acid and transcription factors.
25,"the process of plaque destabilization and rupture remains an area of intense investigation. while reductions in lumen cross sectional area induced by early, non occlusive lesions are compensated by remodeling and expansion of the artery, further plaque enlargement leads to an uncompensated reduction in lumen area and an increase in surface shearing forces. we hypothesize that these local increases in wall shear stress lead to a reduction in smooth muscle cell proliferation and increase in cell death. using a primate prosthetic graft model, we have observed that alterations in nitric oxide and platelet derived growth factor metabolism are important regulators of intimal growth and regression. we suggest that these factors may also be influential in the process of fibrous cap atrophy and plaque rupture.",2000,10865835,Mechanisms of vascular atrophy and fibrous cap disruption.

27,"increases in the environmental osmolarity are key determinants for the growth of microorganisms. to ensure a physiologically acceptable level of cellular hydration and turgor at high osmolarity, many bacteria accumulate compatible solutes. osmotically controlled uptake systems allow the scavenging of these compounds from scarce environmental sources as effective osmoprotectants. a number of these systems belong to the bcct family (betaine choline carnitine transporter), sodium  or proton coupled transporters (e.g. betp and bett respectively) that are ubiquitous in microorganisms. the bcct family also contains cait, an l carnitine/γ butyrobetaine antiporter that is not involved in osmotic stress responses. the glycine betaine transporter betp from corynebacterium glutamicum is a representative for osmoregulated symporters of the bcct family and functions both as an osmosensor and osmoregulator. the crystal structure of betp in an occluded conformation in complex with its substrate glycine betaine and two crystal structures of cait in an inward facing open conformation in complex with l carnitine and γ butyrobetaine were reported recently. these structures and the wealth of biochemical data on the activity control of betp in response to osmotic stress enable a correlation between the sensing of osmotic stress by a transporter protein with the ensuing regulation of transport activity. molecular determinants governing the high affinity binding of the compatible solutes by betp and cait, the coupling in symporters and antiporters, and the osmoregulatory properties are discussed in detail for betp and various bcct carriers.",2010,20923416,The BCCT family of carriers: from physiology to crystal structure.

31,"shewanella oneidensis is an important model organism for its versatility of anaerobic respiration. cyma, a cytoplasmic membrane bound tetraheme c type cytochrome, plays a central role in anaerobic respiration by transferring electrons from the quinone pool to a variety of terminal reductases. although loss of cyma results in defect in respiration of many electron acceptors (eas), a significant share of the capacity remains in general. in this study, we adopted a transposon random mutagenesis method in a cyma null mutant to identify substituent(s) of cyma with respect to nitrite and nitrate respiration. a total of 87 insertion mutants, whose ability to reduce nitrite was further impaired, were obtained. among the interrupted genes, the petabc operon appeared to be the most likely candidate given the involvement of the cytochrome bc1 complex that it encodes in electron transport. subsequent analyses not only confirmed that the complex and cyma were indeed functionally overlapping in nitrate/nitrite respiration but also revealed that both proteins were able to draw electrons from ubiquinone and menaquinone. furthermore, we found that expression of the bc1 complex was affected by oxygen but not nitrate or nitrite and by global regulators arca and crp in an indirect manner.",2014,24650148,Evidence for function overlapping of CymA and the cytochrome bc1 complex in the Shewanella oneidensis nitrate and nitrite respiration.

36,"control elements of many genes are regulated by multiple activators working in concert to confer the maximal level of expression, but the mechanism of such synergy is not completely understood. the promoter of the human macrophage colony stimulating factor (m csf) receptor presents an excellent model with which we can study synergistic, tissue specific activation for two reasons. first, myeloid specific expression of the m csf receptor is regulated transcriptionally by three factors which are crucial for normal hematopoiesis: pu.1, aml1, and c/ebpalpha. second, these proteins interact in such a way as to demonstrate at least two examples of synergistic activation. we have shown that aml1 and c/ebpalpha activate the m csf receptor promoter in a synergistic manner. as we report here, aml1 also synergizes, and interacts physically, with pu. 1. detailed analysis of the physical and functional interaction of aml1 with pu.1 and c/ebpalpha has revealed that the proteins contact one another through their dna binding domains and that aml1 exhibits cooperative dna binding with c/ebpalpha but not with pu.1. this difference in dna binding abilities may explain, in part, the differences observed in synergistic activation. furthermore, the activation domains of all three factors are required for synergistic activation, and the region of aml1 required for synergy with pu.1 is distinct from that required for synergy with c/ebpalpha. these observations present the possibility that synergistic activation is mediated by secondary proteins contacted through the activation domains of aml1, c/ebpalpha, and pu.1.",1998,9632776,Multiple functional domains of AML1: PU.1 and C/EBPalpha synergize with different regions of AML1.

38,"to test the hypothesis that a critical stenosis prevents delayed preconditioning against stunning, studies were conducted in pigs chronically instrumented with occluders and segment shortening crystals. in the setting of a critical stenosis, a preconditioning stimulus of repetitive brief occlusions resulted in infarction. thereafter, a single 10 minute occlusion was used as the preconditioning stimulus. delayed preconditioning against stunning was documented on subsequent days by the deficit of function following brief repetitive occlusions. in contrast to experiments in the naïve heart, the deficit of function improved on the day after a single 10 minute occlusion (from 60+/ 14 to 24+/ 6 arbitrary units, p=0.003), and similar improvement occurred when reperfusion was performed through a critical stenosis (32+/ 6 units, p=0.02 vs. naïve and p=0.34 vs. no stenosis). delayed preconditioning also reduced the frequency of ventricular fibrillation, and produced a 4 fold increase in both calcium dependent and calcium independent nos activity. thus, a critical stenosis did not prevent delayed preconditioning against stunning.",2009,20160844,Determinants of delayed preconditioning against myocardial stunning in chronically-instrumented pigs.

41,"cell cycle regulated protein ubiquitination and degradation within subcellular domains may be essential for the normal progression of mitosis. cdc27 is a conserved component of an essential m phase ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome. we examined the subcellular distribution of cdc27 in greater detail in mammalian cells and found cdc27 concentrated at spindle poles and on spindle microtubules as previously described, but also found cdc27 at kinetochores and along chromosome arms. this localization was not dependent on intact microtubules. while the great majority of cdc27 protein in m phase cells is highly phosphorylated, only the dephosphorylated form of cdc27 was found associated with isolated chromosomes. kinases that also associate with isolated chromosomes catalyzed the in vitro phosphorylation of the chromosome associated cdc27. microinjection of anti cdc27 antibody into cells causes arrest at metaphase. microinjection of cells with anti mad2 antibody normally induces premature anaphase onset resulting in catastrophic nondisjunction of the chromosomes. however, coinjection of anti cdc27 antibody with anti mad2 antibody resulted in metaphase arrest. the association of dephosphorylated apc/c components with mitotic chromosomes suggests mechanisms by which the spindle checkpoint may regulate apc/c activity at mitosis.", ,12429948,The dephosphorylated form of the anaphase-promoting complex protein Cdc27/Apc3 concentrates on kinetochores and chromosome arms in mitosis.
42,"the interaction between streptococcus uberis and bovine lactoferrin (blf) has been characterized. the binding of 125i blf to s. uberis was time dependent and displaceable by unlabeled blf. the scatchard plot was linear and approximately 7,800 binding sites were expressed by each bacterial cell, with an affinity of 1.0 x 10( 7) m. both heat and protease treatment of bacterial cells reduced blf binding significantly, indicating the presence of a cell surface localized protein receptor for the glycoprotein. one protein was identified from the cell wall of s. uberis as the functionally active blf binding protein and it existed in both monomeric and dimeric forms. the recombinant protein expressed in e. coli cells was able to bind blf and had molecular weights similar to that of native s. uberis. deletion analysis located the blf binding domain to a 200 amino acid region at the amino terminus of lbp. analysis of the primary and secondary structure suggested that lbp is an m like protein. an isogenic mutant of s. uberis lacking the internal sequence of the lbp gene was constructed by allele replacement. adherence experiments with wild type s. uberis and the lbp mutant revealed that lbp is not responsible for attachment of s. uberis to host epithelial cells.",2003,14521879,Characterization of a bovine lactoferrin binding protein of Streptococcus uberis.
43,"exogenous prostaglandin (pge2) contracts bovine and human coronary arteries but its precursor, arachidonic acid, relaxes them. the endoperoxides pgh2 and pgh3 relax bovine coronary strips, but pgh1 produces contraction. the primary prostaglandins exert opposite effects to their own endoperoxide precursors, thus, pge2 and pge3 contract, and pge1 relaxes the bovine coronary arteries. the paradoxical coronary dilation produced by the arachidonate or the pgh2 suggest that little if any coronary isomerase which converts endoperoxide into pge2 exists, or that a novel, potent, pg like substance is produced by the isolated coronary arteries. although the coronaries do not possess thromboxane a2 synthetase activity, the vessels are profoundly contracted by exogenous thromboxane a2. thromboxane a2 can be synthesized and released by circulating platelets when they are aggregated by endothelial injury or thrombin. thus, coronary tone, and possible spasm, in ischemic myocardial zones may be influenced markedly by interplay between prostaglandins, endoperoxides, and thromboxane formed by platelets on the one hand, and endoperoxide products synthesized endogenously in the coronary arteries on the other.",1977,831285,"Coronary tone modulation: formation and actions of prostaglandins, endoperoxides, and thromboxanes."

51,"upregulation of the pro inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf) occurs rapidly in the brain following ischaemia, although it is unclear whether this represents a neurotoxic or neuroprotective response. we have investigated whether tnf has different actions in the pre  and postischaemic periods in a tissue culture model of cerebral ischaemia. organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from 8 10 day old rats and maintained in vitro for 14 days. neuronal damage was induced by either 1 h oxygen glucose deprivation or 3 h exposure to nmda or the superoxide generator duroquinone, and assessed after 24 h by propidium iodide fluorescence. tnf pretreatment was neuroprotective against both oxygen glucose deprivation and duroquinone. this effect was associated with an activation of the transcription factor nfkappab and upregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase, and was prevented by a free radical scavenger. when addition of tnf was delayed until the postinsult period, an exacerbation of neurotoxicity occurred, which was also prevented by a free radical scavenger. the actions of tnf are determined by whether tnf is present before or after an ischaemia related insult. both actions are mediated through the production of free radicals, and the response to tnf is determined by whether a cell is metabolically competent to respond by synthesis of antioxidant defences.",2000,11069581,Attenuation and augmentation of ischaemia-related neuronal death by tumour necrosis factor-alpha in vitro.

58,"tumors of the small bowel are quite rare for unknown reasons, although they resemble colorectal tumors in many respects. the purpose of this study was to determine whether abnormalities in the expression of several cell cycle control genes are of importance in small bowel tumorigenesis by comparing a series of samples of normal mucosa, adenomatous polyps, and adenocarcinomas. the levels of cyclin d1, cyclin e, p16, p21, p27, and p53 proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry in samples of normal small bowel (n = 16), small bowel adenomas (n = 20), and small bowel adenocarcinomas (n = 24). normal small bowel mucosa expressed p27 protein, but not the other cell cycle related proteins. about 20% of the tumors displayed a decrease in the expression of this protein. the most frequent alteration in the tumors was an increase in the p16 protein. increased expression of p53 was associated with tumor progression because it was overexpressed in 45% of the adenomas and 65% of the adenocarcinomas (p<0.05). advanced age and increased detection of cyclin d1 and p53 were associated with a decreased 3 year survival (p<0.05). cell cycle abnormalities are early and important events in the multistep process of small bowel tumorigenesis, thus resembling colorectal carcinogenesis. as in colon cancer, deregulated expression of g1 proteins may perturb cell cycle control in benign adenomas of the small bowel and thereby enhance tumor progression. increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors in tumors may serve as a defense mechanism for tumor progression.",1999,10613343,Abnormalities in the expression of cell cycle-related proteins in tumors of the small bowel.

67,"alamethicin and several related microbial polypeptides, which contain a high proportion of alpha aminoisobutyric acid (aib) residues, possess the ability to modify the permeability properties of phospholipid bilayer membranes. alamethicin induces excitability phenomena in model membranes and has served as an excellent model for the study of voltage sensitive transmembrane channels. this review summarizes various aspects of the structural chemistry and membrane modifying properties of alamethicin and related aib containing peptides. the presence of aib residues in these sequences, constrains the polypeptides to 3(10) or alpha helical conformations. functional membrane channels are formed by aggregation of cylindrical peptide helices, which span the lipid bilayer, forming a scaffolding for an aqueous column across the membrane. after consideration of the available data on the conductance characteristics of alamethicin channels, a working hypothesis for a channel model is outlined. channel aggregates in the lipid phase may be stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, involving a central glutamine residue and also by interactions between the macro dipoles of proximate peptide helices. fluctuations between different conductance states are rationalized by transitions between states of different aggregation and hence altered dimensions of the aqueous core or by changes in net dipole moment of the aggregate. ion fluxes through the channel may also be affected by the electric field within the aqueous core.",1983,6302469,Alamethicin and related membrane channel forming polypeptides.

71,"although metastasis tumor antigen 1 (mta1) contributes to the responsiveness of macrophages to lps, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. here, we investigated the role of mta1 in the regulation of expression and function of myd88, a proximal component of nf κb signaling. we discovered that mta1 targets myd88 and that myd88 is a nf κb responsive gene in lps stimulated macrophages. we found that mta1 is required for myd88 dependent stimulation of nf κb signaling and expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as il 1β, mip2, and tnf α as mta1 depletion leads to a substantial reduction in the expression of nf κb target genes. in addition, lps mediated stimulation of myd88 transcription was accompanied by an enhanced recruitment of mta1, rna polymerase ii, and p65rela complex to the nf κb consensus sites in the myd88 promoter. interestingly, the recruitment of both mta1 and myd88 expression is effectively blocked by nf κb inhibitor parthenolide. selective knockdown of myd88 by a dominant negative mutant of myd88 or selective sirna also impairs the ability of lps to stimulate the nf κb target genes. these findings reveal an inherent coregulatory role of mta1 upon the expression of myd88 and suggest that mta1 regulation of myd88 may constitute at least one of the mechanisms by which mta1 stimulates lps induced nf κb signaling in stimulated macrophages.",2010,20702415,MTA1 coregulator regulates LPS response via MyD88-dependent signaling.

two cross sectional surveys were conducted in two different seasons dry season (october 2010) and rainy season (may 2011) among the same school age children (sac) in two rural schools in northern ghana. the study population consisted of 228 school age children. a qualitative 24 hour dietary recall was conducted in both seasons. based on 13 food groups, a score of 1 was given if a child consumed a food item belonging to a particular food group, else 0. individual scores were aggregated into dds for each child. differences in mean dds between seasons were compared using linear mixed model analysis.
the dietary pattern of the sac was commonly plant foods with poor consumption of animal source foods. the mean dds was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the rainy season (6.95 ± 0.55) compared to the dry season (6.44 ± 0.55) after adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, occupation (household head and mother) and education of household head. the difference in mean dds between dry and rainy seasons was mainly due to the difference in the consumption of vitamin a rich fruits and vegetables between the seasons. while vitamin a rich fruits (64.0% vs. 0.9%; p < 0.0001) and vitamin a rich dark green leafy vegetables (52.6% vs. 23.3%, p < .0001) were consumed more during the rainy season than the dry season, more children consumed vitamin a rich deep yellow, orange and red vegetables during the dry season than during the rainy season (73.7% vs. 36.4%, p <0.001).
seasonality has an effect on dds and may affect the quality of dietary intake of sac; in such a context, it would be useful to measure dds in different seasons. since dds is a proxy indicator of micronutrient intake, the difference in dds may reflect in seasonal differences in dietary adequacy and further studies are needed to establish this.",2017,28806418,Seasonality affects dietary diversity of school-age children in northern Ghana.

91,"employing reconstitution assays and measurement of cytochrome p 450 content, lanosterol 14 alpha demethylase and cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase have been studied in solubilized preparations of rat hepatic microsomes. both activities have been resolved from other cytochrome p 450 isozymes and each other by chromatography on deae sephacel and adsorption on hydroxylapatite. the demethylase has been further purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography on mono s resin. the purified cytochrome displays a specific content of 15.8 nmol of heme/mg of protein and a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent mr of 51,000. a soret maximum for the reduced/co binding complex at 448 nm is observed. reconstitution of the purified cytochrome with nadph cytochrome c reductase, dilaurylphosphatidylcholine, nadph, and o2 supports the demethylation process which is inhibited by co. reconstitution also affords accumulation of oxygenated, metabolic intermediates with single catalytic turnover of the cytochrome, thus supporting the hypothesis that a single isozyme of cytochrome p 450 is responsible for all three oxidations and the lyase activity involved in the lanosterol c 32 demethylation sequence. low oxidase activity toward several xenobiotic substrates and selectivity toward endogenous sterol substrates is observed for the purified cytochrome. these results indicate a high degree of substrate specificity for the cytochrome, which would be expected for a constitutive p 450 involved in anabolic biochemical processes.",1986,3771545,Microsomal enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis.

93,"this study investigated the possible involvement of prostaglandin h2, an acetylcholine induced endothelium derived contracting factor in rat aorta, in the development of abnormality of the vasculature in diabetes. rings of thoracic aorta were prepared from control wistar kyoto and stz induced diabetic rats to examine the changes in isometric tension. in 10( 7) m norepinephrine precontracted rings, acetylcholine induced relaxations, which were significantly impaired in diabetic rats. inhibition of thromboxane a2 prostaglandin h2 receptors with ono 3708 (10( 6) m) prevented the development of the impairment of relaxation in diabetic rats. thromboxane a2 synthesis inhibition with oky 046 (10( 5) m) did not affect the acetylcholine induced relaxation in both control and diabetic rats. in aortic rings under resting tension, acetylcholine induced a contraction that was greater in diabetic than control rats, when the nitric oxide production was inhibited by ng nitro l arginine methylester (10( 4) m). this acetylcholine induced contraction was observed only in the rings with intact endothelium and was completely abolished by ono 3708 (10( 6) m). the concentration of 6 keto prostaglandin f1 alpha in the solution bathing diabetic rat aortic rings increased significantly after acetylcholine (10( 5) m) administration. prostacyclin (10( 9) 10( 6) m) did not induce contractions at all. prostacyclin is unlikely to mediate contractions because of its low contractile potency.(abstract truncated at 250 words)",1993,8349035,Role of prostaglandin H2 as an endothelium-derived contracting factor in diabetic state.
94,"diabetic nephropathy is the main cause of end stage renal damage. oxidative stress is involved in the etiology of diabetic nephropathy and intracellular calcium is reported to play a considerable role in the development of renal damage in the diabetic kidney. calcium antagonism can slow the progression of renal impairment in diabetes. the present study was thus designed to examine the effect of a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, on renal function, oxidative stress, and nitric oxide (no) release in streptozotocin (stz) induced diabetic rats. diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of stz (65 mg/kg) in rats. after 4 weeks of stz injection, the rats were divided in to four groups: control rats, diabetic rats treated with saline, and two groups of diabetic rats treated with diltiazem (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p, respectively) for 8 weeks starting from 4 weeks after stz injection. renal function was assessed by creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance, and urea clearance. oxidative stress was measured by renal malondialdehyde (mda), reduced glutathione (gsh), superoxide dismutase (sod), and catalase. we also measured renal nitrite levels. at the end of the 8 weeks, diabetic rats exhibited renal dysfunction as evidenced by reduced creatinine and urea clearance along with enhanced albumin excretion rate as compared with control rats. biochemical analysis of kidneys revealed a marked increase in oxidative stress demonstrated by increased lipid peroxidation and decreased activities of key antioxidant enzymes, gsh, sod, and catalase in diabetic rats. release of no also significantly higher in diabetic rats than controls. chronic treatment with diltiazem in diabetic rats significantly attenuated both renal dysfunction and oxidative stress along with increased no levels as compared with untreated diabetic rats. the kidneys of diabetic rats showed morphological changes such as hyaline casts, glomerular thickening, and moderate interstitial fibrosis and arteriolopathy, whereas diltiazem administration markedly prevented diabetic induced renal morphological alterations. the present study suggests that oxidative stress/nitrosative stress is increased in the diabetic kidney and calcium channel blockage can prevent these changes. the results also suggest that in stz induced diabetic rats, the protective action of diltiazem might be mediated, at least in part, by its effect on tissue oxidant/antioxidant status.",2005,15957552,Diltiazem attenuates oxidative stress in diabetic rats.
95,"sensory placodes are ectodermal thickenings that give rise to elements of the vertebrate cranial sensory nervous system, including the inner ear and nose. although mutations have been described in humans, mice and zebrafish that perturb ear and nose development, no mutation is known to prevent sensory placode formation. thus, it has been postulated that a functional redundancy exists in the genetic mechanisms that govern sensory placode development. we describe a zebrafish deletion mutation, b380, which results in a lack of both otic and olfactory placodes. the b380 deletion removes several known genes and expressed sequence tags, including dlx3 and dlx7, two transcription factors that share a homoeobox domain similar in sequence to the drosophila distal less gene. dlx3 and dlx7 are expressed in an overlapping pattern in the regions that produce the otic and olfactory placodes in zebrafish. we present evidence suggesting that it is specifically the removal of these two genes that leads to the otic and olfactory phenotype of b380 mutants. using morpholinos, antisense oligonucleotides that effectively block translation of target genes, we find that functional reduction of both dlx genes contributes to placode loss. expression patterns of the otic marker pax2.1, olfactory marker anxv and eya1, a marker of both placodes, in morpholino injected embryos recapitulate the reduced expression of these genes seen in b380 mutants. we also examine expression of dlx3 and dlx7 in the morpholino injected embryos and present evidence for existence of auto  and cross regulatory control of expression among these genes. we demonstrate that dlx3 is necessary and sufficient for proper otic and olfactory placode development. however, our results indicate that dlx3 and dlx7 act in concert and their importance in placode formation is only revealed by inactivating both paralogs.",2002,12070088,Concerted action of two dlx paralogs in sensory placode formation.

105,"cross linking of fas (cd95) induces apoptosis, a response that has been reported to depend upon the ras activation pathway. since many examples of apoptosis have been reported to involve ap 1 and/or the ap 1 activation pathway. since many examples of apoptosis have been reported to involve ap 1 and/or the ap 1 activating enzyme jun kinase (jnk), downstream effectors of ras or ras like small gtp binding proteins, we evaluated the role of these molecules in fas mediated apoptosis. although cross linking of fas on jurkat t cells did result in jnk activation, increased activity was observed relatively late, being detectable only after 60 min of stimulation. expression of a dominant negative form of sek1 that blocked fas mediated induction of jnk activity had no effect on fas mediated apoptosis. furthermore, maximally effective concentrations of anti fas did not cause jnk activation if apoptosis was blocked by a cysteine protease inhibitor, suggesting that under these conditions, activation of jnk may be secondary to the stress of apoptosis rather than a direct result of fas engagement. despite the activation of jnk, there was no induction of ap 1 activity as determined by gel shift assay or induction of an ap 1 responsive reporter. the lack of a requirement for ap 1 induction in fas mediated death was further substantiated with jurkat cells that were stably transfected with a dominant negative cjun, tam 67. while tam 67 effectively prevented ap 1 dependent transcription of both the interleukin 2 and cjun genes, it had no effect on fas induced cell death, even at limiting levels of fas signaling. thus, induction of jnk activity in jurkat cells by ligation of fas at levels sufficient to cause cell death is likely a result, rather than a cause, of the apoptotic response, and ap 1 function is not required for fas induced apoptosis.",1997,8972197,Lack of a role for Jun kinase and AP-1 in Fas-induced apoptosis.

128,"hemodiafiltration with on line endogenous reinfusion (hfr) is an extracorporeal dialytic method that combines diffusion, convection and adsorption. hfr supra (hfr s) is a second generation system with increased convective permeability and adsorption capability. previous studies suggested that hfr reduces oxidative stress compared to standard haemodialysis. the principal aim of the present study was to compare antioxidant vitamins behavior and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients treated with hfr and hfr s.
the study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, crossover trial. forty one patients were recruited from 19 dialysis centers and after a 4 month washout stabilization period in on line hemodiafiltration (ol hdf), each patient was randomized to a sequence of treatments (hfr s followed by hfr or viceversa) with each treatment applied over 6 months. plasma levels of advanced oxidation protein products, total antioxidant status, vitamins c, a and e and their ligands (retinol binding protein and total lipids) were measured at baseline and at the end of each treatment period.
results show that the higher convective permeability of hfr s with respect to hfr did not produce additional beneficial effects on the patients' oxidative status, a slight decrease of both vitamin a and retinol binding protein being the only difference registered in the long term. however, as compared to ol hdf, both the re infusive techniques allowed to reduce the intradialytic loss of vitamin c and, in the long term, improve the patients' oxidative status and increase retinol binding protein plasma values. no significant differences were found between the vitamin c concentration of pre  and post cartridge uf neither in hfr s nor in hfr showing that the sorbent resin does not adsorb vitamin c.
hfr s and hfr are almost equivalent in term of impact on antioxidant vitamins and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients. nonetheless, as compared to ol hdf, both treatments produced a sensible sparing of vitamin c and may represent a new approach for reducing oxidative stress and related complications in dialysis patients. long term effects of re infusive treatments on patients' cardiovascular morbidity and mortality need to be evaluated.

136,"disorders of ammonia metabolism including urea cycle enzymopathies, reye syndrome, and liver failure are associated with brain edema and severe neurological impairment. excess blood borne ammonia crosses the blood brain barrier by diffusion as nh(3) where it interacts with various cellular processes involved in neurotransmission and brain energy metabolism. ammonia exerts a potent effect on glutamate (ampa) receptor mediated neurotransmission. ammonia also inhibits high affinity transport of glutamate by an action on astrocytic glutamate transporter expression, an action which results in increased extracellular concentrations of glutamate. acute hyperammonemia directly activates the nmda subclass of glutamate receptors resulting in increased intracellular ca(2+) and increased synthesis of nitric oxide and cgmp. chronic hyperammonemia, on the other hand, results in a loss of nmda receptor sites. activation of nmda receptors in acute ammonia toxicity results in depletion of atp in brain. neuropathologic studies in experimental animals with congenital urea cycle disorders and severe hyperammonemia reveal evidence of neuronal cell death which is excitotoxic in nature. these findings suggest that overactivation of nmda receptors is a significant feature of acute hyperammonemic syndromes and that antagonists of these receptors or of their signal transduction pathway enzymes such as nnos could be beneficial in the treatment of the central nervous system manifestations (encephalopathy, brain edema) which are characteristic of hyperammonemic disorders.",2001,11754522,Glutamate transporter and receptor function in disorders of ammonia metabolism.

162,"faithful genome duplication and inheritance require the complete resolution of all intertwines within the parental dna duplex. this is achieved by topoisomerase action ahead of the replication fork or by fork rotation and subsequent resolution of the dna precatenation formed. although fork rotation predominates at replication termination, in vitro studies have suggested that it also occurs frequently during elongation. however, the factors that influence fork rotation and how rotation and precatenation may influence other replication associated processes are unknown. here we analyze the causes and consequences of fork rotation in budding yeast. we find that fork rotation and precatenation preferentially occur in contexts that inhibit topoisomerase action ahead of the fork, including stable protein dna fragile sites and termination. however, generally, fork rotation and precatenation are actively inhibited by timeless/tof1 and tipin/csm3. in the absence of tof1/timeless, excessive fork rotation and precatenation cause extensive dna damage following dna replication. with tof1, damage related to precatenation is focused on the fragile protein dna sites where fork rotation is induced. we conclude that although fork rotation and precatenation facilitate unwinding in hard to replicate contexts, they intrinsically disrupt normal chromosome duplication and are therefore restricted by timeless/tipin.

179,"the hippo signaling acts as a tumor suppressor pathway that negatively regulates taz and yap. increasing evidence supports the activation of taz and yap in breast cancer. moreover, the hippo pathway is involved in the biology of non neoplastic cells residing in the tumor microenvironment. on this basis, we herein assessed taz and yap in triple negative breast cancer and its surrounding microenvironemnt in order to investigate their impact on pathological complete response (pcr) and tumor recurrence.
sixty one triple negative breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were retrospectively evaluated. taz and yap were assessed by immunohistochemistry and classified as positive or negative according to the percentage of tumor expressing cells, cellular localization, and staining intensity. taz and yap expression was also evaluated in non lymphocytic stromal cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (tils) and endothelial cells. the pearson's chi squared test of independence was used to test the association between taz/yap and clinical molecular factors. a multivariate logistic regression model was generated to identify variables impacting pcr. the kaplan meier method and the log rank test were used for estimating and comparing survival curves. cox proportional regression models were built to evaluate the risk of recurrence for the variables considered. internal validation was carried out with a re sampling without replacement method.
we did not observe any impact on pcr rate when taz and yap were addressed singularly. conversely, the combined expression of yap in tumor cells and non lymphocytic stromal cells was an independent predictor of reduced pcr rate in the multivariate model (or 7.13, 95% ci: 1.23 41.41, p = 0.029). next, the combined expression of taz and yap was associated with shorter disease free survival (dfs) in multivariate analysis (hr 3.07, 95% ci: 1.24 7.61, p = 0.016). the robustness of these findings were internally validated.
the combined expression of yap in tnbc cells and in the surrounding stroma seems to be associated with a decreased likelihood to achieve pcr. conversely, the combined expression of taz and yap in tumor cells conferred poor survival outcomes.",2016,27039292,Topographic expression of the Hippo transducers TAZ and YAP in triple-negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
180,"it has been well established that diet high in cholesterol and saturated fatty acids could significantly elevate plasma cholesterol levels and also increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. we hypothesize that repeated systemic escherichia coli (e. coli) in conjunction with hypercholesterolemia, leads to development of oxidative stress that may affect the development and progression of inflammatory cvd. swiss albino mice (4 weeks old) were randomly assigned to high cholesterol diet (hcd) or normal laboratory diet (nld) groups. at 10 weeks of age, mice were inoculated intravenously with e. coli or vehicle for 24 weeks. serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, c reactive protein levels, blood glucose level and selective antioxidant enzymes throughout the systemic infection period in murine aorta, heart and liver during hypercholesterolemia, were examined. serum cholesterol levels were elevated in hcd fed mice, compared to nld. the blood colony forming units (cfu) of e. coli suggested persistence of systemic infection. the antioxidant enzyme levels were elevated in e. coli infected groups as compared to controls. the myeloperoxidase content of aortic tissue was significantly higher in all groups infected with e. coli. our study suggests that during hypercholesterolemia, repeated systemic e. coli infection induces an endogenous antioxidant response that serves to modulate vascular inflammation leading to cardiovascular diseases.",2009,19221870,Repeated systemic Escherichia coli infection enhances anti-oxidant response in hypercholesterolemic mice inducing cardiovascular inflammation.

the goals of this study were to describe the distribution of thcy among a representative sample of children and adolescents in jos, nigeria, and to test for differences in thcy among sex and age categories.
the sampling scheme, which included persons aged 10 to 19 years, was a stratified, multistage probability design. this cross sectional study involved 182 school children drawn from secondary schools in jos, nigeria between january and july 2003. fasting venous samples were collected and assayed for thcy, total protein and albumin. anthropometric measurements were taken.

187,"effects of fixation with glutaraldehyde (ga), glutaraldehyde osmium tetroxide (ga oso(4)), and osmium tetroxide (oso(4)) on ion and atp content, cell volume, vital dye staining, and stability to mechanical and thermal stress were studied in ehrlich ascites tumor cells (eatc). among variables investigated were fixation time, fixative concentration, temperature, osmolality of the fixative agent and buffer, total osmolality of the fixative solution, osmolality of the postfixation buffer, and time of postfixation treatment in buffer (sutherland, r. m., et al. 1967. j. cell physiol.69:185.). rapid loss of potassium, exchangeable magnesium, and atp, and increase of vital dye uptake and electrical conductivity occurred with all fixatives studied. these changes were virtually immediate with ga oso(4) or oso(4) but slower with ga (in the latter case they were dependent on fixative temperature and concentration) (foot, n. c. 1950. in mcclung's handbook of microscopical technique. 3rd edition. 564.). total fixative osmolality had a marked effect on cell volume with oso(4) but little or no effect with ga or ga oso(4). osmolality of the buffer had a marked effect on cell volume with oso(4), whereas with ga or ga oso(4) it was only significant at very hypotonic buffer osmolalities. concentration of ga had no effect on cell volume. osmolality of the postfixation buffer had little effect on cell volume, and duration of fixation or postfixation treatment had no effect with all fixatives. freezing and thawing or centrifugal stress (up to 100,000 g) had little or no effect on cell volume after all fixatives studied. mechanical stress obtained by sonication showed that oso(4) alone produced poor stabilization and that ga fixation alone produced the greatest stabilization. the results indicate that rapid membrane permeability changes of eatc follow fixative action. the results are consistent with known greater stabilizing effects of ga on model protein systems since cells were also rendered relatively stable to osmotic stress during fixation, an effect not noted with oso(4). after fixation with ga and/or oso(4) cells were stable to osmotic, thermal, or mechanical stress; this is inconsistent with several earlier reports that ga fixed cells retain their osmotic properties.",1974,4138889,"Influence of glutaraldehyde and-or osmium tetroxide on cell volume, ion content, mechanical stability, and membrane permeability of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells."

207,"application of 2 pyridinyl thermolabile protecting groups (2 pytpgs) for protection of hydroxyl, phosphate, and carboxyl functions is presented in this unit. their characteristic feature is a unique removal process following the intramolecular cyclization mechanism and induced only by temperature rise. deprotection rate of 2 pytpgs is dependent on certain parameters, such as solvent (aqueous or non aqueous medium), ph values, and electron distribution in a pyridine ring. the presented approach pertains not only to protecting groups but also to an advanced system of controlling certain properties of 2 pyridinyl derivatives. we improved the ""chemical switch"" method, allowing us to regulate the protecting group stability by inversing the electron distribution in 2 pytpg. together with ph values manipulation, this allows us to regulate the protecting group stability. moreover, phosphite cyclization to oxazaphospholidine provides a very stable but easily reversible tool for phosphate protection/modifications. for all tpgs we confirmed their utility in a system of protecting groups. this concept can contribute to designing the general protecting group that could be useful in bioorganic chemistry. © 2017 by john wiley & sons, inc.",2017,28252183,"2-Pyridinyl Thermolabile Groups as General Protectants for Hydroxyl, Phosphate, and Carboxyl Functions."

235,"telomeres are specialized structures that protect chromosome ends from degradation and fusion events. in most organisms, telomeres consist of short, repetitive g rich sequences added to chromosome ends by a reverse transcriptase with an internal rna template, called telomerase. specific dna binding protein complexes associate with telomeric sequences preventing chromosome ends from being recognized as dna double strand breaks (dsbs). telomeres that lose their cap activate the dna damage response (ddr) likewise dsbs and, if inappropriately repaired, generate telomeric fusions, which eventually lead to genome instability. in drosophila there is not telomerase, and telomere length is maintained by transposition of three specialized retroelements. however, fly telomeres are protected by multi protein complexes like their yeast and vertebrate counterparts; these complexes bind chromosome ends in a sequence independent fashion and are required to prevent checkpoint activation and end to end fusion. uncapped drosophila telomeres elicit a ddr just as dysfunctional human telomeres. most interestingly, uncapped drosophila telomeres also activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (sac) by recruiting the sac kinase bubr1. bubr1 accumulations at chromosome ends trigger the sac that inhibits the metaphase to anaphase transition. these findings, reviewed here, highlight an intriguing and unsuspected connection between telomeres and cell cycle regulation, providing a clue to understand human telomere function.",2009,19270525,Drosophila cell cycle under arrest: uncapped telomeres plead guilty.

the diabetes autoimmunity study in the young (daisy) has followed for development of islet autoimmunity and diabetes general population newborns carrying human leukocyte antigen (hla) genotypes conferring risk for type 1 diabetes and young siblings or offspring of people with type 1 diabetes. testing for autoantibodies was performed at least once in 2234 and twice or more in 1887 children. among the latter, 100 children tested positive on at least two consecutive visits. to date, 92 children have developed persistent islet autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (gad65), insulin, or insulinoma associated antigen 2 (ia 2) and had at least two subsequent clinic visits. these children had study visits with point of care testing for hba1c and random glucose every 3 6 months and those with random plasma glucose above 11.1 mmol/l or hba1c above 6.3% were evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist for clinical diabetes.
during a mean follow up of 3.4 yr from onset of autoimmunity, 28 children developed type 1 diabetes, at mean age of 6.5 yr. mean prediagnostic hba1c was 5.1% [standard deviation (sd) = 0.4%]. in a cox regression model accounting for changes in values in individuals over time, increase in hba1c predicted increased risk of progression to type 1 diabetes, hazard ratio = 4.8 (95% confidence interval 3.0 7.7) for each sd of 0.4%, independent of random glucose and number of autoantibodies. increase in random plasma glucose levels only marginally predicted risk of progression (hazard ratio = 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.02 1.8, per sd of 1.1 mmol/l).

244,"senescent fibroblasts are known to promote tumor growth. however, the exact mechanism remains largely unknown. an important clue comes from recent studies linking autophagy with the onset of senescence. thus, autophagy and senescence may be part of the same physiological process, known as the autophagy senescence transition (ast). to test this hypothesis, human fibroblasts immortalized with telomerase (htert bj1) were stably transfected with autophagy genes (bnip3, ctsb or atg16l1). their overexpression was sufficient to induce a constitutive autophagic phenotype, with features of mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and a shift toward aerobic glycolysis, resulting in l lactate and ketone body production. autophagic fibroblasts also showed features of senescence, with increased p21(waf1/cip1), a cdk inhibitor, cellular hypertrophy and increased β galactosidase activity. thus, we genetically validated the existence of the autophagy senescence transition. importantly, autophagic senescent fibroblasts promoted tumor growth and metastasis, when co injected with human breast cancer cells, independently of angiogenesis. autophagic senescent fibroblasts stimulated mitochondrial metabolism in adjacent cancer cells, when the two cell types were co cultured, as visualized by mitotracker staining. in particular, autophagic atg16l1 fibroblasts, which produced large amounts of ketone bodies (3 hydroxy butyrate), had the strongest effects and promoted metastasis by up to 11 fold. conversely, expression of atg16l1 in epithelial cancer cells inhibited tumor growth, indicating that the effects of autophagy are compartment specific. thus, autophagic senescent fibroblasts metabolically promote tumor growth and metastasis, by paracrine production of high energy mitochondrial fuels. our current studies provide genetic support for the importance of ""two compartment tumor metabolism"" in driving tumor growth and metastasis via a simple energy transfer mechanism. finally, β galactosidase, a known lysosomal enzyme and biomarker of senescence, was localized to the tumor stroma in human breast cancer tissues, providing in vivo support for our hypothesis. bioinformatic analysis of genome wide transcriptional profiles from tumor stroma, isolated from human breast cancers, also validated the onset of an autophagy senescence transition. taken together, these studies establish a new functional link between host aging, autophagy, the tumor microenvironment and cancer metabolism.",2012,22684298,Autophagy and senescence in cancer-associated fibroblasts metabolically supports tumor growth and metastasis via glycolysis and ketone production.
245,"gamma secretase inhibitors are one promising approach to the development of a therapeutic for alzheimer's disease (ad). gamma secretase inhibitors reduce brain beta amyloid peptide (abeta), which is believed to be a major contributor in the etiology of ad. transgenic mice overexpressing the human beta amyloid precursor protein (app) are valuable models to examine the dynamics of abeta changes with gamma secretase inhibitors in plaque free and plaque bearing animals. bms 299897 2 [(1r) 1 [[(4 chlorophenyl)sulfony](2,5 difluorophenyl)amino]ethyl] 5 fluorobenzenepropanoic acid, a gamma secretase inhibitor, showed dose  and time dependent reductions of abeta in brain, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), and plasma in young transgenic mice, with a significant correlation between brain and csf abeta levels. because csf and brain interstitial fluid are distinct compartments in composition and location, this correlation could not be assumed. in contrast, aged transgenic mice with large accumulations of abeta in plaques showed reductions in csf abeta in the absence of measurable changes in plaque abeta in the brain after up to 2 weeks of treatment. hence, csf abeta levels were a valuable measure of gamma secretase activity in the central nervous system in either the presence or absence of plaques. transgenic mice were also used to examine potential side effects due to notch inhibition. bms 299897 was 15 fold more effective at preventing the cleavage of app than of notch in vitro. no changes in the maturation of cd8(+) thymocytes or of intestinal goblet cells were observed in mice treated with bms 299897, showing that it is possible for gamma secretase inhibitors to reduce brain abeta without causing notch mediated toxicity.",2005,15452193,"Dynamics of {beta}-amyloid reductions in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma of {beta}-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice treated with a {gamma}-secretase inhibitor."

253,"cardiomyocyte death after ischemia/reperfusion correlates with oxidant stress, and antioxidants confer protection in that model. preconditioning (pc) with hypoxia or adenosine also confers protection, leading us to hypothesize that pc protects by attenuating oxidant generation during subsequent ischemia/reperfusion. chick cardiomyocytes were preconditioned with 10 minutes of hypoxia or adenosine (100 micromol/l), followed by 1 hour of simulated ischemia and 3 hours of reperfusion. adenosine pc decreased cell death from 50+/ 3% to 18+/ 4% and enhanced the return of contractions during reperfusion, as observed previously with hypoxic pc. a transient burst of dichlorofluorescein (sensitive to h2o2 oxidation that was significantly attenuated by pc initiated by hypoxia or adenosine was seen at reperfusion. the protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor go 6976 and the mitochondrial atp sensitive k(+) (k(atp)) channel inhibitor 5 hydroxydecanoate each abolished protection and abrogated the pc induced attenuation of reperfusion oxidant stress. by contrast, when given only at reperfusion, the k(+) channel opener pinacidil or the antioxidants 2 mercaptopropionylglycine and 1,10 phenanthroline decreased oxidant stress at reperfusion and improved survival and return of contractions. thus, pc protection is associated with an attenuation of the oxidant burst at reperfusion, regardless of the method by which pc is triggered. loss of pc protection associated with pkc inhibition or k(atp) channel inhibitors is associated with a restoration of that oxidant stress. these results suggest a mechanism for pc protection and reveal a functional link between pkc activation and k(atp) channel activation in that pathway.",2000,10720416,Preconditioning in cardiomyocytes protects by attenuating oxidant stress at reperfusion.

radioactivity based enzyme assays, western and immunoblotting using specific antibodies and molecular modeling were used to characterize substrate specificity of ash1l and setd2.
here we report on the assay development and kinetic characterization of ash1l and setd2 and their substrate specificities in vitro. both enzymes were active with recombinant nucleosome as substrate. however, setd2 but not ash1l methylated histone peptides as well indicating that the interaction of the basic post set extension with substrate may not be critical for setd2 activity. both enzymes were not active with nucleosome containing a h3k36a mutation indicating their specificity for h3k36. analyzing the methylation state of the products of ash1l and setd2 reactions also confirmed that both enzymes mono  and dimethylate h3k36 and are inactive with h3k4 as substrate, and that only setd2 is able to trimethylate h3k36 in vitro.
we determined the kinetic parameters for ash1l and setd2 activity enabling screening for inhibitors that can be used to further investigate the roles of these two proteins in health and disease. both ash1l and setd2 are h3k36 specific methyltransferases but only setd2 can trimethylate this mark. the basic post set extension is critical for ash1l but not setd2 activity.

(1980) j. biol. chem. 255, 1771 1774], the 29,000 dalton polypeptide of the isolated yeast omm fraction has been tentatively identified as porin. evidence to substantiate this identification was provided by the finding that both the porin activity and the 29,000 dalton polypeptide were entirely resistant when the omm fraction was exposed to trypsin digestion, with the 29,000 dalton polypeptide being virtually the only polypeptide in the omm fraction to be unaffected by trypsin digestion. there was no protection when trypsin digestion was carried out in the presence of detergent. using monospecific antibodies, we have shown that yeast porin is apparently not synthesized as a larger precursor in a cell free translation system. in vitro synthesized porin could not be integrated into dog pancreas microsomal vesicles or into an isolated omm fraction from yeast, either co  or posttranslationally. in vitro synthesized porin, however, could be integrated posttranslationally into whole isolated mitochondria. this membrane specificity suggests that integration does not proceed by unassisted partitioning. the integration of porin into whole mitochondria occurred with fidelity by the criterion of its resistance to trypsin. moreover, integration was not inhibited in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m chlorophenyl hydrazone whereas translocation into the mitochondrial matrix of the in vitro synthesized gamma subunit of f1 atpase was inhibited.",1982,6296816,"In vitro synthesis and integration into mitochondria of porin, a major protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae."

315,"yeast members of the ormdl family of endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane proteins play a central role in lipid homeostasis and protein quality control. in the absence of yeast orm1 and orm2, accumulation of long chain base, a sphingolipid precursor, suggests dysregulation of sphingolipid synthesis. physical interaction between orm1 and orm2 and serine palmitoyltransferase, responsible for the first committed step in sphingolipid synthesis, further supports a role for the orm proteins in regulating sphingolipid synthesis. phospholipid homeostasis is also affected in orm1delta orm2delta cells: the cells are inositol auxotrophs with impaired transcriptional regulation of genes encoding phospholipid biosynthesis enzymes. strikingly, impaired growth of orm1delta orm2delta cells is associated with constitutive unfolded protein response, sensitivity to stress, and slow er to golgi transport. inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis suppresses orm1delta orm2delta phenotypes, including er stress, suggesting that disrupted sphingolipid homeostasis accounts for pleiotropic phenotypes. thus, the yeast orm proteins control membrane biogenesis by coordinating lipid homeostasis with protein quality control.",2010,20212121,Orm1 and Orm2 are conserved endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins regulating lipid homeostasis and protein quality control.
316,"during the early postimplantation period, rodent embryos survive in a relatively anaerobic environment in utero and are vulnerable to a high oxygen pressure. they become resistant to oxygen stress when they are exposed to a higher oxygen pressure after the uteroplacental circulation is established. however, it is unknown how embryos acquire such resistance against oxidative stress. this study was undertaken to examine whether an antioxidant protein thioredoxin (trx) plays a significant role in the embryonic acquisition of the tolerance to oxidative stress. e7.5 embryos of c57bl/6 wild type (wt) and human trx (htrx) inserted transgenic (tg) embryos were cultured under 10 or 25% o2 and their growth and morphological differentiation were evaluated. the trx expression and the products of oxidative stress (8 hydroxy 2' deoxy guanosine and carbonylated proteins) in their tissues were also examined. when wt embryos were cultivated in vitro under 25% o2, their growth was significantly disturbed and various developmental abnormalities were induced, which did not occur in embryos grown under 10% o2. however, such embryotoxic effects of oxygen were significantly attenuated in the htrx tg embryos that continuously express htrx. accumulation of the products of oxidative stress was significantly reduced in htrx tg embryos as compared with that in wt embryos. the trx transgene appears to provide the embryo with the resistance against oxidative stress and may play a crucial role in the redox regulation in embryos.",2002,12448820,"Thioredoxin, an anti-oxidant protein, protects mouse embryos from oxidative stress-induced developmental anomalies."
317,"accumulating evidence suggests that neuroepithelial bodies are airway o(2) sensors. recently, we have established the h 146 small cell lung carcinoma line as a suitable model to study the biochemical basis of neuroepithelial body cell chemotransduction. here we explore the possibility that hypoxic modulation of k(+) channels is intimately linked to activity of nadph oxidase. graded hypoxia caused graded inhibition of whole cell k(+) currents, which correlated well with membrane depolarization. pretreatment with the phorbol ester, 12 o tetradecanoyl (tpa), inhibited k(+) currents at all potentials. although 4alpha phorbol 12,13 didecanoate and tpa in the presence of bisindolylmaleimide were also able to depress k(+) currents, only tpa could significantly ameliorate hypoxic depression of these currents. thus, protein kinase c (pkc) activation modulates the sensitivity of these cells to changes in po(2). furthermore, because the addition of h(2)o(2), a downstream product of nadph oxidase, could only activate k(+) currents during hypoxia (when endogenous h(2)o(2) production is suppressed), it appears likely that pkc modulates the affinity of nadph oxidase for o(2) potentially via phosphorylation of the p47(phox) subunit, which is present in these cells. these data show that pkc is an important regulator of the o(2) transduction pathway and suggests that nadph oxidase represents a significant component of the airway o(2) sensor.",2000,10713079,O(2) sensing by airway chemoreceptor-derived cells.

we performed genome wide exon array analysis and developed a splicing profile in murine hearts with hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction for 8 weeks. following global analysis of splice variants using the mouse exon 1.0 st array, we identified 46 spliced genes and narrowed our focus to 1 gene, mitochondrial tumor suppressor 1 (mtus1), whose splice variants were registered in the ncbi refseq database. notably, one of the splice variants mtus1a was specifically upregulated, although the total expression of the mtus1 gene remained unchanged. we showed that mtus1a was localized in the mitochondria, and its expression level increased with the degree of cardiac hypertrophy. in cultured cardiomyocytes, mtus1a overexpression reduced phenylephrine induced reactive oxygen species production and consequent erk phosphorylation, resulting in a decrease in both cell size and protein synthesis. in vivo, cardiac specific mtus1a transgenic mice showed left ventricle wall thinning and a reduced hypertrophic response to pressure overload and phenylephrine treatment.
we found that mtus1 is specifically spliced in hypertrophic hearts and that the mtus1a variant has an inhibitory effect on cardiac hypertrophy. mtus1a is, therefore, a possible diagnostic and therapeutic target for cardiac hypertrophy and failure.",2016,27385424,Identification of the Mtus1 Splice Variant as a Novel Inhibitory Factor Against Cardiac Hypertrophy.

334,"signalling via the notch receptor is a key regulator of many developmental processes. the differential responsiveness of notch expressing cells to the ligands delta and serrate is controlled by fringe, itself essential for normal patterning in drosophila and vertebrates. the mechanism of fringe action, however, is not known. the protein has an amino terminal hydrophobic stretch resembling a cleaved signal peptide, which has led to the widespread assumption that it is a secreted signalling molecule. it also has distant homology to bacterial glycosyltransferases, although it is not clear if this reflects a shared enzymatic activity, or merely a related structure.
we report that a functional epitope tagged form of drosophila fringe was localised in the golgi apparatus. when the putative signal peptide was replaced by a confirmed one, fringe no longer accumulated in the golgi, but was instead efficiently secreted. this change in localisation dramatically reduced its biological activity, implying that the wild type protein normally acts inside the cell. we show that fringe specifically binds the nucleoside diphosphate udp, a feature of many glycosyltransferases. furthermore, specific mutation of a dxd motif (in the single letter amino acid code where x is any amino acid), a hallmark of most glycosyltransferases that use nucleoside diphosphate sugars, did not affect the golgi localisation of the protein but completely eliminated in vivo activity.

catalase and glutathione peroxidase concentrations were significantly correlated with the level of fecal calprotectin in patients with ibd. nevertheless, there were no significant correlations between the concentrations of the above mentioned enzymes and c reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or the activity scores of ibd patients. it should be noted that mda and total antioxidant capacity levels did not correlate with the inflammatory markers or the disease activity scores.
there was a positive correlation between fecal calprotectin and serum antioxidant enzymes in patients with ibd, but, there was no correlation between antioxidant and oxidative markers in terms of disease activity scores. hence, the observed significant correlation between the antioxidant enzymes and the fecal calprotectin may be due to either the pro oxidant potential of calprotectin or its antioxidant role.",2018,29753375,Positive Correlation of Fecal Calprotectin With Serum Antioxidant Enzymes in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Accidental Numerical Correlation or a New Finding?
340,"improvement of the cell free protein synthesis system (cf) over the past decade have made it one of the most powerful protein production methods. the cf approach is especially useful for stable isotope (si) labeling of proteins for nmr analysis. however, it is less popular than expected, partly because the si labeled amino acids used for si labeling by the cf are too expensive. in the present study, we developed a simple and inexpensive method for producing an si labeled protein using escherichia coli cell extract based cf. this method takes advantage of endogenous metabolic conversions to generate si labeled asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, and tryptophan, which are much more expensive than the other 16 kinds of si labeled amino acids, from inexpensive sources, such as si labeled algal amino acid mixture, si labeled indole, and sodium sulfide, during the cf reaction. as compared with the conventional method employing 20 kinds of si labeled amino acids, highly enriched uniform si labeling with similar labeling efficiency was achieved at a greatly reduced cost with the newly developed method. therefore, our method solves the cost problem of the si labeling of proteins using the cf.",2010,21052777,An economical method for producing stable-isotope labeled proteins by the E. coli cell-free system.

343,"the mechanism of copper uptake in saccharomyces cerevisiae has been investigated using a combination of 64cu2+ and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. a wild type copper resistant cup 1r containing strain and a strain carrying a deletion of the cup1 locus (yeast copper metallothionein) exhibited quantitatively similar saturable energy dependent 64cu2+ uptake when cultures were pregrown in copper free media (medium [cu] approximately 15 nm). the kinetic constants for uptake by the wild type strain were vmax = 0.21 nmol of copper/min/mg of protein and km = 4.4 microm. this accumulation of 64cu2+ represented net uptake as confirmed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. this uptake was not seen in glucose starved cells, but was supported in glycerol  and ethanol grown ones. uptake was inhibited by both n3  and dinitrophenol and was barely detectable in cultures at 4 degrees c. when present at 50 microm, zn2+ and ni2+ inhibited by 50% indicating that this uptake process was relatively selective for cu2+. 64cu2+ accumulation was qualitatively and quantitatively different in cultures either grown in or preincubated with cold cu2+. either treatment resulted in the appearance of a fast phase (t 1/2 approximately 1 min) of 64cu2+ accumulation which represented isotopic exchange since it did not lead to an increase in the mass of cell associated copper; also, it was not energy dependent. exchange of 64cu2+ into this pool was not inhibited by zn2+. pretreatment with cu2+ caused a change in the rate of net accumulation as well; a 3 h incubation of cells in 5 microm medium cu2+ caused a 1.6 fold increase in the velocity of energy dependent uptake. prior addition of cycloheximide abolished this cu2(+) dependent increase and, in fact, inhibited the 64cu2+ uptake velocity by greater than 85%. the exchangeable pool was also absent in cycloheximide, cu2(+) treated cells suggesting that exchangeable cu2+ derived from the copper taken up initially by the energy dependent process. the thionein deletion mutant was similar to wild type in response to medium cu2+ and cycloheximide indicating that copper metallothionein is not directly involved in cu2+ uptake (as distinct from retention) in yeast.",1990,2188974,Copper uptake in wild type and copper metallothionein-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

347,"pulmonary vasodilators are important in the management of pulmonary hypertension. although systemic vasodilators may be effective in lowering pulmonary artery pressure, systemic vasodilation is the main limitation to dose titration. this review summarizes the latest research and developments in pulmonary vasodilators in the management of acute and chronic pulmonary hypertension.
nitric oxide, the prototype of selective pulmonary vasodilators, remains an effective option in the management of pulmonary hypertension; however, cost and complexity of administration have led to consideration of other pulmonary vasodilators. animal research suggests that nitric oxide may have an important role in the prevention of pulmonary hypertension after cardiopulmonary bypass. experience with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy, suggests that these agents improve cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and can be considered as alternatives and/or adjuncts to nitric oxide. prostacyclins are a versatile class of pulmonary vasodilator as they have been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics administered intravenously or via inhalation. endothelin receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective for long term management of pulmonary hypertension. several gene therapy strategies are currently undergoing evaluation.
selective pulmonary vasodilation can be achieved through delivery of vasodilators directly to the lungs or targeting pulmonary specific processes. several therapeutic options are available that demonstrate selectivity for the pulmonary vasculature. these agents can facilitate optimization of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics.",2006,16547439,Treatment of pulmonary hypertension with selective pulmonary vasodilators.

350,"borna disease virus (bdv) is a nonsegmented, negative stranded rna virus characterized by noncytolytic persistent infection and replication in the nuclei of infected cells. to gain further insight on the intracellular trafficking of bdv components during infection, we sought to generate recombinant bdv (rbdv) encoding fluorescent fusion viral proteins. we successfully rescued a virus bearing a tetracysteine tag fused to bdv p protein, which allowed assessment of the intracellular distribution and dynamics of bdv using real time live imaging. in persistently infected cells, viral nuclear inclusions, representing viral factories tethered to chromatin, appeared to be extremely static and stable, contrasting with a very rapid and active trafficking of bdv components in the cytoplasm. photobleaching (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching [frap] and fluorescence loss in photobleaching [flip]) imaging approaches revealed that bdv components were permanently and actively exchanged between cellular compartments, including within viral inclusions, albeit with a fraction of bdv p protein not mobile in these structures, presumably due to its association with viral and/or cellular proteins. we also obtained evidence for transfer of viral material between persistently infected cells, with routing of the transferred components toward the cell nucleus. finally, coculture experiments with noninfected cells allowed visualization of cell to cell bdv transmission and movement of the incoming viral material toward the nucleus. our data demonstrate the potential of tetracysteine tagged recombinant bdv for virus tracking during infection, which may provide novel information on the bdv life cycle and on the modalities of its interaction with the nuclear environment during viral persistence.

352,"xbp1, a transcriptional repressor of saccharomyces cerevisiae with homology to swi4 and mbp1, is induced by stress and starvation during the mitotic cycle. it is also induced late in the meiotic cycle. using rna differential display, we find that genes encoding three cyclins (cln1, cln3, and clb2), cys3, and smf2 are downregulated when xbp1 is overexpressed and that xbp1 can bind to sequences in their promoters. during meiosis, xbp1 is highly induced and its mrna appears at the same time as dit1 mrna, but its expression remains high for up to 24 h. as such, it represents a new class of meiosis specific genes. xbp1 deficient cells are capable of forming viable gametes, although ascus formation is delayed by several hours. furthermore, xbp1 target genes are normally repressed late in meiosis, and loss of xbp1 results in their derepression. interestingly, we find that a deletion of cln1 also reduces the efficiency of sporulation and delays the meiotic program but that sporulation in a deltacln1 deltaxbp1 strain is not further delayed. thus, cln1 may be xbp1's primary target in meiotic cells. we hypothesize that cln1 plays a role early in the meiotic program but must be repressed, by xbp1, at later stages to promote efficient sporulation.",2000,10611226,CLN1 and its repression by Xbp1 are important for efficient sporulation in budding yeast.

to elucidate the prognostic impact of crip1, we analyzed tissues from 58 primary invasive thyroid carcinomas using immunohistochemistry. western blotting was performed to investigate crip1 protein expression in the thyrocyte cell line nthy ori 3 1 and four different thyroid carcinoma cell lines, k1, tpc 1, tt, and sw579. endogenous expression of crip1 was suppressed using a sirna (si crip1). the 3 (4,5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl) 2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to investigate cell viability. flow cytometric analysis was used to detect cell cycle progression and cell apoptosis. the effects of silencing crip1 on cell migration and invasion were detected using the transwell assay.
the immunohistochemistry results showed that crip1 was overexpressed in thyroid carcinoma. crip1 expression was associated with tumor size, tnm stage, and lymphatic metastasis, but not with age, gender, and tumor location. in addition, the expression of crip1 in k1, tpc 1, tt, and sw529 cells was higher than that in the nthy ori 3 1 cells. the highest expression was observed in the sw579 and tt cells. furthermore, silencing crip1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of thyroid carcinoma cell lines sw579 and tt. we also found that silencing crip1 induced g1 arrest and apoptosis of thyroid carcinoma cell lines sw579 and tt.

in this work, we have generated a list of 1279 genes that are differentially expressed in response to altered nr2e1 expression during in vivo neocortex development. we have refined this list to 64 candidate direct targets of nr2e1. our data suggested distinct roles for nr2e1 during different neocortex developmental stages. most importantly, our results suggest a possible novel pathway by which nr2e1 regulates neurogenesis, which includes lhx2 as one of the candidate direct target genes, and sox9 as a co interactor.

therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of hesperidin against doxorubicin induced cardiac toxicity.
four groups of animals were used in this study. first group served as a control and injected with the vehicle. second group was given 200 mg/kg of hesperidin orally for seven consecutive days. the third group was injected with a single dose (20 mg/kg) of doxorubicin intraperitoneally and was sacrificed after 48 h. the fourth group was treated with hesperidin for seven days but on day five, 1 hour after hesperidin treatment, rats were injected with the single dose of doxorubicin. on day seven, the rats were scarified by decapitation. blood was collected and processed for determination of serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), creatine kinase (ck) and no. the hearts were removed and processed for both histopathological examination and determination of oxidative stress parameters like reduced glutathione (gsh), lipid peroxide (tbars) levels and superoxide dismutase (sod) activity.
our results showed that doxorubicin produced severe cardiotoxicity as indicated from increase in serum ldh, ck activities and no level. histopathological examination of dox treated rats revealed degenerative changes in heart tissues. the significant decrease in gsh levels, sod activity and increase in tbars levels, indicated that dox induced cardiotoxicity was mediated through ros generation. on the other hand, pretreatment of rats with hesperidin protected cardiac tissues against the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin as evidenced from amelioration of histopathological changes and normalization of cardiac biochemical parameters.

degenerated human ivd tissue was analyzed for nitrosylation by immunofluorescence. in addition, human np cells were isolated from ivds, expanded and stimulated either with peroxynitrite itself or a stable peroxynitrite donor (sin 1). nitrosylation, accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, nf kappab nuclear translocation, and cell viability were analyzed by fluorescence. gene expression of tnf alpha, il 1beta, il 6, il 8, and il 10 was quantified by real time (rt) pcr.
degenerated ivd tissue showed strong nitrosylation, especially in the np. isolated human np cells showed a strong signal for nitrosylation and intracellular reactive oxygen species on stimulation with peroxynitrite or sin 1. nf kappab/p65 sustained nuclear translocation of nf kappab/p65 and stimulation of il 1beta, il 6, and il 8 expression was noted on treatment of cells with sin 1.

(1997) protein eng. 10, 1415 1424]. nonadditive effects on ligand binding are observed when one to four mutations are inserted, indicating either conformational changes in the protein or different cooperativity patterns in the ligand ligand interactions. from steady state kinetics, addition of q67h mutations does not drastically affect formation of the nadph.dihydrofolate complex; however, a large energy difference between the productive and nonproductive complexes is no longer maintained. a role for q67 in discriminating between these various states is proposed. since theories of protein evolution suggest gene duplication followed by accumulation of mutations can lead to divergence of activity, this study is a first step toward asking if introduction of asymmetric mutations in the quadrupled r67 dhfr gene can lead to optimization of ligand binding sites.",2002,12501195,"Breaking symmetry: mutations engineered into R67 dihydrofolate reductase, a D2 symmetric homotetramer possessing a single active site pore."

399,"during the first meiotic prophase in male mammals, sex chromosomes undergo a program of transcriptional silencing called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (msci). msci is triggered by accumulation of proteins like brca1, atr, and γh2ax on unsynapsed chromosomes, followed by local changes on the sex chromatin, including histone modifications, incorporation of specific histone variants, non histone proteins, and rnas. it is generally thought that msci represents the transition of unsynapsed chromatin from a transcriptionally active state to a repressed state. however, transcription is generally low in the whole nucleus during the early stages of the first meiotic prophase, when markers of msci first appear, and is then reactivated globally during pachytene. thus, an alternative possibility is that msci represents the targeted maintenance and/or reinforcement of a prior repressed state, i.e., a failure to reactivate. here, we present an analysis of the temporal and spatial appearance of transcriptional and msci markers, as well as chromatin modifications related to transcriptional regulation. we show that levels of rna pol ii and histone h3 acetylated at lysine 9 (h3k9ac) are low during leptotene, zygotene, and early pachytene, but increase strongly in mid pachytene, indicating that reactivation occurs with some delay after synapsis. however, while transcription markers appear abundantly on the autosomes at mid pachytene, they are not directed to the sex chromosomes. interestingly, we found that chromatin modifications related to transcriptional silencing and/or msci, namely, histone h3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (h3k9me3), histone h3 monomethylated at lysine 4 (h3k4me1), γh2ax, sumo1, and xmr, appear on the sex chromosomes before autosomes become reactivated. these results suggest that the onset of msci during late zygotene and early pachytene may prevent sex chromosome reactivation during mid pachytene instead of promoting inactivation de novo. additionally, we found temporal differences between the x and y chromosomes in the recruitment of dna repair and msci markers, indicating a differential regulation of these processes. we propose that many of the meiotic defects attributed to failure to silence sex chromosomes could be interpreted as a more general process of transcriptional misregulation that occurs under certain pathological circumstances in zygotene and early pachytene.",2012,22366883,Inactivation or non-reactivation: what accounts better for the silence of sex chromosomes during mammalian male meiosis?

405,"we studied the role of cysteine as an intracellular radiation protector under conditions in which both oxygen and thiols were monitored at 37 degrees c. in hct 116 human colon cancer cells, the intracellular cysteine content affects the radiation survival dramatically at intermediate oxygen levels, but not at zero or high oxygen levels. using a spin through oil method with a dual radioactive label detection system, we measured intracellular cysteine and glutathione (gsh) levels for cells in suspension culture. a comparison of the cysteine levels of monolayer cells lysed in situ and of trypsinized monolayer cells in suspension (horan et al., cytometry 29, 76 82, 1997) revealed that, upon trypsinization from monolayer culture and transfer to a spinner apparatus at 37 degrees c, hct 116 cells lose most of their intracellular cysteine. over the 60 min time course of control experiments, these cells do not recover intracellular cysteine despite the availability of cystine (the disulfide of cysteine) in the medium. when cells in spinner culture are provided with exogenous cysteine, they initially concentrate it to 10 fold the extracellular concentration, with the concentration factor decreasing to about 5 fold over the course of an hour. the intracellular gsh concentration changes little throughout this period, regardless of the changes in cysteine levels. the same apparatus was used to assess the survival of hct 116 cells irradiated at 37 degrees c under conditions of constant po(2) monitoring. for cells without added cysteine, the oxygen concentration for half maximal radiation sensitivity was about 7.5 mmhg (intermediate hypoxia), more than twice the commonly accepted value (3 mmhg). at 7.5 mmhg, cells with added cysteine (intracellular concentration 3.5 mm) were almost as radioresistant as severely hypoxic cells (approximately 0.005% oxygen). cells in parallel experiments in which the cells were grown in monolayers on glass petri dishes had intermediate cysteine values and also intermediate radiosensitivity. we conclude that the radiation response of cells at intermediate oxygen levels is controlled predominantly by intracellular cysteine levels and that the cysteine levels commonly found in tumors may increase the k(m) for radiosensitivity to values much higher than suggested previously.",2001,11554850,The K(m) for Radiosensitization of Human Tumor Cells by Oxygen is Much Greater than 3 mmHg and is Further Increased by Elevated Levels of Cysteine.
406,"doxorubicin is one of the most active cytotoxic agents in current use. it has proven efficacy in various malignancies either alone or combined with other cytocidal agents. the clinical usefulness of the anthracycline drug has been precluded by cardiac toxicity. many therapeutic interventions have been attempted to improve the therapeutic benefits of the drug. few, however, have been efficacious in this setting.
we have addressed in the current study the possible protective effects of naringenin, a flavonoid known to have anti oxidant properties, on doxorubicin induced cardiac toxicity in male swiss albino rats.
forty male swiss albino rats were used in this study. naringenin (25 mg/kg body weight) was administered daily by gavage for 7 consecutive days before a cumulative single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg body weight, ip).
doxorubicin induced marked biochemical alterations characteristic of cardiac toxicity including, elevated activities of serum total lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and creatine phosphokinase (cpk), enhanced lipid peroxidation measured as malondialdehyde (mda). the anthracycline drug has also reduced the cardiac enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione s transferase (gst) and catalase (cat). besides, it reduced significantly the reduced glutathione (gsh) level, but it increased the total no content in heart tissue. prior administration of naringenin ahead of doxorubicin challenge ameliorated all these biochemical markers.
taken together, one could conclude that naringenin has a protective role in the abatement of doxorubicin induced cardiac toxicity that resides, at least in part, on its anti radical effects and regulatory role on no production.",2005,17102822,Abatement by naringenin of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in rats.
407,"conjugated linoleic acid (cla) is a dietary fatty acid that has received considerable attention due to its unique properties in rodent models including anti cancer, anti atherogenic and anti diabetic effects. the effects of cla are similar to those seen with ligands for peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppars), most notably of the ppar gamma subtype. with the recent observation of a role for ppar gamma in regulation of immune responses, we suspected that cla could affect immune function, in particular macrophage activity. the goal of our study was to examine whether this dietary fatty acid has anti inflammatory properties similar to those reported for ppar gamma activators such as 15 deoxy prostaglandin j(2) (pgj(2)). in reporter assays, various cla isomers activated ppar gamma in raw264.7 mouse macrophage (raw) cells. cla decreased the interferon gamma (ifn gamma) induced mrna expression of mediators of inflammation including cyclooxygenase 2 (cox2), inducible nos (inos), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha). reporter assays also demonstrated reduced ifn gamma stimulated transcriptional activity of the inos and cox2 promoters by cla. consequently, cla decreased the production of pge(2), tnfalpha and the inflammatory agent nitric oxide (no) in raw cells treated with ifn gamma. other pro inflammatory cytokines such as il 1 beta and il 6 were similarly decreased by cla treatment of raw cells. in addition, various cla isomers induced hl60 cell differentiation along the monocytic lineage as assessed by measuring expression of the cell surface marker cd14. this differentiation process, as well as the regulation of inos and cox2 by 15dpgj(2), is believed to involve ppar gamma. mutations of leu(468) and glu(471) to alanine in helix 12 of the ligand binding domain of ppar gamma resulted in a protein with strong dominant negative activity (dnppar gamma). transfecting dnppar gamma into raw cells eliminated the ability of various cla isomers to regulate the inos reporter construct. taken together, these results suggest that cla has anti inflammatory properties that are mediated, at least in part, by the nuclear hormone receptor ppar gamma.",2002,12020636,Conjugated linoleic acid decreases production of pro-inflammatory products in macrophages: evidence for a PPAR gamma-dependent mechanism.

430,"genetic deafness is one of the most common human genetic birth defects. to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying human hereditary deafness, deaf animal strains have proved to be invaluable models. the german waltzing guinea pig is a new strain of animals with unidentified gene mutation(s), displaying recessively inherited cochleovestibular impairment. histological investigations of the homozygous animals (gw/gw) revealed a collapse of the endolymphatic compartment and malformation of stria vascularis. rt pcr showed a significant reduction in expression of the strial intermediate cell specific gene dct and the tight junction gene cldn11 in the embryonic day (e)40 and adult gw/gw cochlear lateral wall. immunohistochemical analysis of the gw/gw cochlea showed loss of the tight junction protein cldn11 in strial basal cells from e40, loss of the potassium channel subunit kcnj10 in strial intermediate cells from e50, and loss of the na k cl cotransporter slc12a2 in strial marginal cells from e50. in addition, a temporary loss of the gap junction protein gjb2 (connexin 26) between fibrocytes in the spiral ligament of the e50 gw/gw cochlea was observed. the barrier composed of tight junctions between strial basal cells was disrupted in the gw/gw cochlea as indicated by a biotin tracer permeability assay. in conclusion, spatiotemporal loss of k+ transport proteins in the cochlear lateral wall is caused by malformation of the stria vascularis in the developing german waltzing guinea pig inner ear. this new animal strain may serve as a good model for studying human genetic deafness due to disruption of inner ear ion homeostasis.",2008,18093167,Spatiotemporal loss of K+ transport proteins in the developing cochlear lateral wall of guinea pigs with hereditary deafness.

458,"the influence of ca2+ on hepatic gluconeogenesis was measured in the isolated perfused rat liver at different cytosolic nad(+) nadh potentials. lactate and pyruvate were the gluconeogenic substrates and the cytosolic nad(+) nadh potentials were changed by varying the lactate to pyruvate ratios from 0.01 to 100. the following results were obtained: a) gluconeogenesis from lactate plus pyruvate was not affected by ca(2+) free perfusion (no ca2+ in the perfusion fluid combined with previous depletion of the intracellular pools); gluconeogenesis was also poorly dependent on the lactate to pyruvate ratios in the range of 0.1 to 100; only for a ratio equal to 0.01 was a significantly smaller gluconeogenic activity observed in comparison to the other ratios. b) in the presence of ca2+, the increase in oxygen uptake caused by the infusion of lactate plus pyruvate at a ratio equal to 10 was the most pronounced one; in ca(2+) free perfusion the increase in oxygen uptake caused by lactate plus pyruvate infusion tended to be higher for all lactate to pyruvate ratios; the most pronounced difference was observed for lactate/pyruvate ratio equal to 1. c) in the presence of ca2+ the effects of glucagon on gluconeogenesis showed a positive correlation with the lactate to pyruvate ratios; for a ratio equal to 0.01 no stimulation occurred, but in the 0.1 to 100 range stimulation increased progressively, producing a clear parabolic dependence between the effects of glucagon and the lactate to pyruvate ratio. d) in the absence of ca2+ the relationship between the changes caused by glucagon in gluconeogenesis and the lactate to pyruvate ratio was substantially changed; the dependence curve was no longer parabolic but sigmoidal in shape with a plateau beginning at a lactate/pyruvate ratio equal to 1; there was inhibition at the lactate to pyruvate ratios of 0.01 and 0.1 and a constant stimulation starting with a ratio equal to 1; for the lactate to pyruvate ratios of 10 and 100, stimulation caused by glucagon was much smaller than that found when ca2+ was present. e) the effects of glucagon on oxygen uptake in the presence of ca2+ showed a parabolic relationship with the lactate to pyruvate ratios which was closely similar to that found in the case of gluconeogenesis; the only difference was that inhibition rather than stimulation of oxygen uptake was observed for a lactate to pyruvate ratio equal to 0.01; progressive stimulation was observed in the 0.1 to 100 range. f) in the absence of ca2+ the effects of glucagon on oxygen uptake were different; the dependence curve was sigmoidal at the onset, with a well defined maximum at a lactate to pyruvate ratio equal to 1; this maximum was followed by a steady decline at higher ratios; at the ratios of 0.01 and 0.1 inhibition took place; oxygen uptake stimulation caused by glucagon was generally lower in the absence of ca2+ except when the lactate to pyruvate ratio was equal to 1. the results of the present study demonstrate that stimulation of gluconeogenesis by glucagon depends on ca2+. however, ca2+ is only effective in helping gluconeogenesis stimulation by glucagon at highly negative redox potentials of the cytosolic nad(+) nadh system. the triple interdependence of glucagon ca(2+) nad(+) nadh redox potential reveals highly complex interrelations that can only be partially understood at the present stage of knowledge.",1997,9361705,Ca2+ dependence of gluconeogenesis stimulation by glucagon at different cytosolic NAD(+)-NADH redox potentials.
459,"the enzymatic breakdown of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinases is considered the major source of the second messenger ceramide. studies on the contribution of the various described acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases to the signaling pool of ceramide have been hampered by the lack of molecular data on the neutral sphingomyelinases (nsmases). we recently identified a mammalian nsmase, an integral membrane protein with remote similarity to bacterial sphingomyelinases. however, its ubiquitous expression pattern is in contrast to previous findings that sphingomyelinase activity is found mainly in brain tissues. by using an improved database search method, combined with phylogenetic analysis, we identified a second mammalian nsmase (nsmase2) with predominant expression in the brain. the sphingomyelinase activity of nsmase2 has a neutral ph optimum, depends on mg(2+) ions, and is activated by unsaturated fatty acids and phosphatidylserine. immunofluorescence reveals a neuron specific punctate perinuclear staining, which colocalizes with a golgi marker in a number of cell lines. the likely identity of nsmase2 with cca1, a rat protein involved in contact inhibition of 3y1 fibroblasts, suggests a role for this enzyme in cell cycle arrest. both mammalian nsmases are members of a superfamily of mg(2+) dependent phosphohydrolases, which also contains nucleases, inositol phosphatases, and bacterial toxins.",2000,10823942,"Cloning and characterization of the mammalian brain-specific, Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase."

465,"an escherichia coli cell transduces extracellular stimuli sensed by chemoreceptors to the state of an intracellular signal molecule, which regulates the switching of the rotational direction of the flagellar motors from counterclockwise (ccw) to clockwise (cw) and from cw back to ccw. here, we performed high speed imaging of flagellar motor rotation and show that the switching of two different motors on a cell is controlled coordinatedly by an intracellular signal protein, phosphorylated chey (chey p). the switching is highly coordinated with a subsecond delay between motors in clear correlation with the distance of each motor from the chemoreceptor patch localized at a cell pole, which would be explained by the diffusive motion of chey p molecules in the cell. the coordinated switching becomes disordered by the expression of a constitutively active chey mutant that mimics the cw rotation stimulating function. the coordinated switching requires chez, which is the phosphatase for chey p. our results suggest that a transient increase and decrease in the concentration of chey p caused by a spontaneous burst of its production by the chemoreceptor patch followed by its dephosphorylation by chez, which is probably a wavelike propagation in a subsecond timescale, triggers and regulates the coordinated switching of flagellar motors.",2011,21539787,Coordinated reversal of flagellar motors on a single Escherichia coli cell.
466,"this paper reports on the efficacy of (f(o)   f(c)) versus (2f(o)   f(c)) electron density maps at 3.2 a resolution. firstly, a study is reported of a simple truncation at 2.3 and 3.2 a of the 1.6 a resolution crystal structure of concanavalin a at room temperature [emmerich et al. (1994), acta cryst. d50, 749 756] with 149 known bound water molecules. secondly, the concanavalin a 1.6 a resolution model was re refined but with the data truncated to 3.2 a. in a similar evaluation, these procedures were repeated for the apocrustacyanin a1 cryotemperature 1.4 a resolution model [cianci et al. (2001), acta cryst. d57, 1219 1229]. maps at 1.4, 2.3 and 3.2 a resolutions were first generated and the structure was then re refined at 3.2 a and additionally at 2.3 a resolution. the results on concanavalin a show that the number of bound water molecules that are resolved decreases by two thirds from 1.6 to 3.2 a, but that key structural waters, for example at the transition metal and the calcium ion, are still resolved in the (f(o)   f(c)) map but not in the (2f(o)   f(c)) map. for apocrustacyanin a1, the results with these two difference maps were less clear cut. two key structural bound waters (w93 and w105) were selected that had been previously identified in beta crustacyanin [cianci et al. (2002), proc. natl acad. sci. usa, 99, 9795 9800] in protein carotenoid interactions. the behaviour of w93 is similar to that of concanavalin a key waters, but that of w105 is not. these behaviours were therefore explored in finer resolution increments, namely 2.9, 2.7 and 2.5 a. finally, further tests on ""real"" data sets for peanut lectin and concanavalin a at medium resolution confirm these map properties, namely that an (f(o)   f(c)) difference electron density map is more effective than a (2f(o)   f(c)) map in showing bound water structure at lower resolutions ( approximately 3.2 a). this result is important since a growing number of protein crystal structure studies are concerned with multi macromolecular complexes and are at such resolutions. details of the bound solvent can still be revealed at 3.2 a via the (f(o)   f(c)) map calculation. the physical basis of the limitation of the (2f(o)   f(c)) map presumably lies in the series termination error effect on such a map involving the first negative ripple from the protein atom to which a bound water oxygen is hydrogen bonded, sufficiently cancelling its peak. in addition, re refinements at 3.2 a show distances that can agree with known values but b values that do not agree with known values.",2003,12777800,The properties of (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc) electron-density maps at medium-to-high resolutions.

483,"the involvement of ethylene and abscisic acid in providing stress tolerance and defence response to plants is widely recognized. however, little is known about the cross talk between glutathione with ethylene and abscisic acid to combat stress in planta. here, transcriptome analysis of combined cold and osmotic stress treated arabidopsis mutants were carried out to elucidate the crosstalk between the abscisic acid, ethylene and glutathione. microarray experiment revealed the differential regulation of about 2313 and 4131 transcripts in ein2 (ethylene insensitive mutant) and aba1.6 (abscisic acid mutant) respectively. functional analysis exposed common down regulated stress and defence, secondary metabolite biosynthesis viz. phenylpropanoid, lignin and flavonols, redox and transcription factors related genes in ein2, aba1.6 and pad2.1 (glutathione mutant) in response to combined stress treatment. the reduced glutathione content was less in stress treated mutants in comparison to col 0. again, selective down regulated transcripts in stress treated mutants were noted up regulated after glutathione feeding. some of the important differentially expressed genes were also validated by comparative proteomics analysis of stress treated mutants. in summary, our results suggested the role of ethylene and abscisic acid in inducing stress responsive genes and proteins by activating glutathione biosynthesis to combat abiotic stress conditions in plant system.",2016,27845361,"Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis mutants suggests a crosstalk between ABA, ethylene and GSH against combined cold and osmotic stress."
484,"a balanced redox homeostasis in the testis is essential for genetic integrity of sperm. reactive oxygen species can disturb this balance by oxidation of glutathione, which is regenerated using nadph, formed by glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh). g6pdh is regulated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) protein. therefore, we studied the redox status and dna damage in testes and sperm of mice that carried a deletion in atm. the redox status in heterozygote mice, reflected by glutathione levels and antioxidant capacity, was lower than in wild type mice, and in homozygotes the redox status was even lower. the redox status correlated with oxidative dna damage that was highest in mice that carried atm deletions. surprisingly, g6pdh activity was highest in homozygotes carrying the deletion. these data indicate that defective atm reduces the redox homeostasis of the testis and genetic integrity of sperm by regulating glutathione levels independently from g6pdh activity.",2016,27318254,Does Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) protect testicular and germ cell DNA integrity by regulating the redox status?

we have recently generated binary (tet on/off) conditional transgenic mice (tet nox2:ve cad tta) that can induce 1.8 ± 0.42 fold increase in nadph oxidase (nox) derived ros specifically in vascular endothelium upon withdrawal of tetracycline from the drinking water. animals were divided in two groups: one exposed to high endogenous ros levels for 8 weeks (short term) and the other for 20 weeks (long term). using endothelial cells (ec) isolated from mouse hearts (mhec), we demonstrate that both short term and long term increase in nox ros induced ampk mediated activation of enos. interestingly, although endothelium dependent nitric oxide (no) mediated coronary vasodilation was significantly increased after short term increase in nox ros, coronary vasodilation was drastically reduced after long term increase in ros. we also show that short term ros increase induced proliferation in ec and angiogenic sprouting in the aorta. in contrast, long term increase in cytosolic ros resulted in nitrotyrosine mediated inactivation of mitochondrial (mito) antioxidant mnsod, increase in mito ros, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (δψm), decreased ec proliferation and angiogenesis.
the findings suggest that nox derived ros results in increased mito ros. whereas short term increase in mito ros was counteracted by mnsod, long term increase in ros resulted in nitrotyrosine mediated inactivation of mnsod, leading to unchecked increase in mito ros and loss of δψm followed by inhibition of endothelial function and proliferation.",2017,28088753,Mitochondrial redox plays a critical role in the paradoxical effects of NAPDH oxidase-derived ROS on coronary endothelium.

animals were divided into control, iron, taurine, and vitamin e/selenium groups. following sacrifice, iron and selenium measurements, histology, and biochemical analyses were performed.
no significant differences were found in heart and liver iron content between treatment groups, except for higher hepatic dry weight iron concentrations in taurine treated animals (p < 0.03). serum iron increased with iron loading (751 +/  66 vs. 251 +/  54 microg/dl, p < 0.001) and with taurine (903 +/  136 microg/dl, p = 0.03).
consistent with oxidative stress, iron overload increased cardiac malondialdehyde levels, decreased heart glutathione peroxidase (gpx) activity, and increased serum aspartate aminotransferase. taurine ameliorated these changes, but only significantly for liver gpx activity. selenium and vitamin e supplementation did not improve oxidative markers and worsened cardiac gpx activity. these results suggest that taurine acts primarily as an antioxidant rather than inhibiting iron uptake. future studies should illuminate the complexity of these results.",2007,17940334,Antioxidant-mediated effects in a gerbil model of iron overload.

546,"plasma and tissue alpha tocopherol concentrations are remarkably stable, which suggests that they are regulated. alpha tocopherol transfer protein, tocopherol associated protein, and tocopherol binding protein bind alpha tocopherol. these proteins might function as tocopherol regulatory proteins, although only tocopherol transfer protein has been shown to influence plasma and tissue alpha tocopherol concentrations. tissue alpha tocopherol concentrations likely depend on tocopherol regulatory protein function and tissue lipid content, vitamin e uptake and efflux, oxidative stress, and interactions between vitamin e and other antioxidants. pharmacokinetic models often divide tissues into rapidly perfused, slowly perfused, and very slowly perfused compartments. tissue vitamin e concentrations might equilibrate more rapidly in tissues with greater perfusion, greater vitamin e uptake, increased amounts or activities of tocopherol regulatory protein, and lower lipid contents. the rate at which tissue concentrations approach equilibrium, however, does not predict the final equilibrium concentrations because of redistribution among tissues. redistribution of vitamin e to adipose tissue from other tissues may be significant. intracellular trafficking of vitamin e might occur in conjunction with membrane recycling because membrane constituents rapidly recycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular endocytic compartments. thus, tocopherol regulatory proteins may modulate rather than directly regulate vitamin e tissue distribution and intracellular trafficking.",2001,11684383,Vitamin E kinetics and the function of tocopherol regulatory proteins.

550,"progesterone (p4) inhibits apoptosis of rat granulosa cells and spontaneously immortalized granulosa cells (sigcs), which were derived from rat granulosa cells. defining the mechanism through which p4 mediates its action has been difficult because these cells do not express the classic nuclear p4 receptor. previous studies have shown that a p4 receptor antibody, c 262, detects a 60 kda protein that is involved in regulating p4's antiapoptotic action. using a c 262 affinity column, this 60 kda protein was isolated and sequenced by mass spectrometry. this analysis revealed that the c 262 detectable protein is an unnamed protein referred to as rda288. this protein has several putative hyaluronic acid binding sites. further hyaluronic acid antagonizes (3)h p4 binding to sigcs and mimics p4's action, whereas exogenous hyaluronic acid binding protein attenuates p4's actions. rt pcr demonstrated that rda288 mrna was present in sigcs, immature rat ovary, lung, and skeletal muscle but was not present in several other organs. forced expression of rda288 increased the capacity of sigcs to bind and respond to p4. an antibody was also developed against rda288. using this antibody in a western blot protocol, rda288 expression was confirmed in both sigcs and granulosa cells. an immunohistochemical study detected rda288 in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane components of granulosa cells of antral follicles. immunocytochemical studies on living nonpermeabilized sigcs revealed that rda288 was present on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. finally, pretreatment with the rda288 antibody blocked p4's antiapoptotic actions. taken together, these data suggest that rda288 plays a significant role in mediating p4's antiapoptotic action in granulosa cells.",2004,14988380,"Involvement of an unnamed protein, RDA288, in the mechanism through which progesterone mediates its antiapoptotic action in spontaneously immortalized granulosa cells."

the study involved 33 soldiers treated for self aggressive behavior from july 1, 1998, to june 30, 1999. average patient age was 20.7 years. the control group consisted of 21 soldiers hospitalized for mental disturbances but not showing autoaggressive tendencies. total cholesterol and activity of platelets, considering the generation of free radicals and triglyceride concentration levels, were determined in the blood serum of members of both groups.
the results indicate significantly lower concentrations of total cholesterol in the serum of soldiers showing self aggressive behaviors. also, increased concentrations of malonyl dialdehyde in blood platelets and decreased superoxide dismutase activity were found in individuals prone to autoaggression.
the results suggest that the dysfunction of oxidation reduction processes in brain tissue leads to excessive generation of free radicals, which can cause brain cell damage and disturb metabolic processes, resulting in mental disturbances that may constitute a background for self aggressive behavior. the decreased activity of superoxide dismutase is a major factor in the observed oxidation reduction disturbances.",2001,11370196,Selected biochemical parameters of blood serum in soldiers committing self-mutilation.

561,"an important epigenetic modification is the methylation/demethylation of histone lysine residues. the first histone demethylase to be discovered was a lysine specific demethylase 1, lsd1, a flavin containing enzyme which carries out the demethylation of di  and monomethyllysine 4 in histone h3. the removed methyl groups are oxidized to formaldehyde. this reaction is similar to those performed by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase and sarcosine dehydrogenase, in which protein bound tetrahydrofolate (thf) was proposed to serve as an acceptor of the generated formaldehyde. we showed earlier that lsd1 binds thf with high affinity which suggests its possible participation in the histone demethylation reaction. in the cell, lsd1 interacts with co repressor for repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (corest). in order to elucidate the role of folate in the demethylating reaction we solved the crystal structure of the lsd1 corest thf complex. in the complex, the folate binding site is located in the active center in close proximity to flavin adenine dinucleotide. this position of the folate suggests that the bound thf accepts the formaldehyde generated in the course of histone demethylation to form 5,10 methylene thf. we also show the formation of 5,10 methylene thf during the course of the enzymatic reaction in the presence of thf by mass spectrometry. production of this form of folate could act to prevent accumulation of potentially toxic formaldehyde in the cell. these studies suggest that folate may play a role in the epigenetic control of gene expression in addition to its traditional role in the transfer of one carbon units in metabolism.",2014,24715612,Crystal structure of the histone lysine specific demethylase LSD1 complexed with tetrahydrofolate.

586,"purple membrane suspension shows two different orientations in electric fields of different frequencies. the orientation at low frequencies (less than or equal to approximately 10 hz), with the membrane surface perpendicular to the electric field, is due to permanent dipole moment of the membrane and the orientation at high frequencies (greater than or equal to approximately 100 hz), with the surface parallel to the electric field, is due to induced dipole moment. by quantitative analysis of these orientations, we determined the permanent dipole moment and the polarizability. both values varied according to the membrane size: the permanent dipole moment ranged from 500 kd to 10 md and was proportional to the square of the diameter of the membrane. the polarizability ranged from 1 x 10( 13) to 1 x 10( 11)cm3 and was proportional to the third to fourth power of the diameter. because the permanent dipole moment was proportional to the area of the membrane, we could determine permanent dipole moment per bacteriorhodopsin. by determining the actual membrane size under electron microscopy, we got 98 d/bacteriorhodopsin. we also concluded that the direction of the permanent dipole moment was from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular side. these values, however, were strongly dependent on the ionic strength in the medium, suggesting a screening effect due to counter ions near the membrane surface. we evaluated the screening effect and showed about a four charge difference between the two sides of the purple membrane. under illumination, we found that the permanent dipole moment decreased from 98 to 63 d/bacteriorhodopsin. from the best oriented sample, we also concluded that the angle of retinal against the axis normal to the membrane surface was greater than 68.6 degrees.",1984,6713073,Anisotropic electric properties of purple membrane and their change during the photoreaction cycle.

597,"the stunted protein (stuap) is a member of a family of transcription factors that regulate fungal development and cell cycle progression. regulated stua gene expression is required for correct cell pattern formation during asexual reproduction (conidiation) and for initiation of the sexual reproductive cycle in aspergillus nidulans. transcriptional initiation from two different promoters yields overlapping mrnas (stua alpha and stuabeta) that upon translation yield the same protein. here we show that multiple regulatory mechanisms interact to control (i) developmental competence dependent expression of both transcripts and (ii) induction dependent expression of stua alpha, but not stuabeta, by the conidiation specific bristle (brlap) transcriptional activator. quantitative levels of both mrnas are further modulated by (i) an activator(s) located at a far upstream upstream activation sequence, (ii) feedback regulation by stuap, and (iii) positive translational regulation that requires the peptide product of a micro open reading frame unique to the stua alpha mrna 5' untranslated region. gradients in stua alpha expression were most important for correct cell and tissue type development. threshold requirements were as follows: metula phialide differentiation < ascosporogenesis < cleistothecial shell hülle cell differentiation. altered stua expression affected conidiophore morphology and conidial yields quantitatively but did not alter the temporal development of cell types or conidiophore density. by contrast, the sexual cycle showed both temporal delay and quantitative reduction in the number of cleistothecial initials but normal morphogenesis of tissue types.",1997,9315680,Aspergillus asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction are differentially affected by transcriptional and translational mechanisms regulating stunted gene expression.

599,"previous studies in experimental animals and patients have suggested a circadian variation in host toxicity following administration of 5 fluorodeoxyuridine (fdurd) although the biochemical mechanisms are not fully understood. thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21), the initial enzyme in the thymidine phosphorylation pathway, is the first enzyme in the anabolism of fdurd. dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (dpd; ec 1.3.1.2), is the rate limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine catabolic pathway and has been shown to be the key enzyme in fdurd catabolism. the present study examined the relationship between the suggested circadian variation in fdurd toxicity and potential circadian variations in the activity of these enzymes. initial studies in sprague dawley rats confirmed that the time of fdurd administration affected death rate and other drug related toxicities including loss of body weight, diarrhea, and bone marrow suppression, with the least toxicity and highest survival rate being observed in rats receiving fdurd at 12:00 noon and 4:00 p.m. and the greatest toxicity and lowest survival rate at 12:00 midnight and 4:00 a.m. statistical analysis revealed a circadian pattern in fdurd toxicity (cosinor analysis, p < 0.001). in subsequent studies with the same species, we simultaneously measured tk and dpd activities in several tissues at various times over 24 h. under standardized light conditions (lights on, 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.; lights off, 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.), with sampling at 4 h intervals (4:00 and 8:00 a.m.; 12:00 noon; 4:00 and 8:00 p.m., and 12:00 midnight), a circadian variation in tk activity was observed (p < 0.0001, cosinor analysis) in bone marrow, intestinal mucosa, liver, and spleen. in the same group of animals, a circadian pattern of dpd activity in liver and bone marrow was also observed (cosinor analysis, p < 0.0001) that was inverse compared to the circadian variation in tk activity (pearson correlation analysis, p < 0.05). further statistical analysis indicated that the observed circadian variation in fdurd toxicity was correlated with the circadian variation of tk activity and inversely correlated with dpd activity (pearson correlation analysis, p < 0.05). based on the above data, we conclude that the circadian pattern of tk and dpd activity may explain the observed circadian variation in toxicity as the time of fdurd administration is varied. these results may be useful in the design of improved chemotherapeutic regimens using time modified administration of fdurd.",1993,8504424,Relationship between circadian-dependent toxicity of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and circadian rhythms of pyrimidine enzymes: possible relevance to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy.

we identified 36 non dyt1 multiplex families in which at least one person had non focal involvement at an age of onset that was younger than 22 years. all three coding exons of thap1 were sequenced, and the clinical features of individuals with mutations were compared with those of individuals who were negative for mutations in thap1. genotype phenotype differences were also assessed.
of 36 families, nine (25%) had members with mutations in thap1, and most were of german, irish, or italian ancestry. one family had the amish mennonite founder mutation, whereas the other eight families each had novel, potentially truncating or missense mutations. the clinical features of the families with mutations conformed to the previously described dyt6 phenotype; however, age at onset was extended from 38 years to 49 years. compared with non carriers, mutation carriers were younger at onset and their dystonia was more likely to begin in brachial, rather than cervical, muscles, become generalised, and include speech involvement. genotype phenotype differences were not found.
mutations in thap1 underlie a substantial proportion of early onset primary dystonia in non dyt1 families. the clinical features that are characteristic of affected individuals who have mutations in thap1 include limb and cranial muscle involvement, and speech is often affected.

immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to evaluate the expression of cox 2 and mpges 1 in benign and malignant lesions including metastases to lymph nodes. amounts of intratumoral pge2 were quantified by enzyme immunoassay. reverse transcription pcr was used to determine the expression of each of the four known receptors (ep(1 4)) for pge2.
immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased expression of cox 2 and mpges 1 in dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, invasive scc, and metastases to lymph nodes. immunoblot analysis confirmed that cox 2 and mpges 1 were consistently overexpressed in scc. pge2 and all four of the pge2 receptor subtypes were detected in each of the tumor samples. elevated levels of cox 2 were also detected in scc arising in an hpv16 transgenic mouse.
increased amounts of cox 2 and mpges 1 were detected in penile intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma. these findings provide the basis for evaluating whether inhibiting cox 2 will be useful in the prevention or treatment of penile scc.",2004,14871981,Cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 are overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.
624,"the mechanism of interaction of the operator dna with the lambda cro repressor protein was investigated using proton n.m.r. and photo cidnp. three kinds of dna duplexes, the lambda or3 17 mer, phi80 or2 19 mer and crp binding site 22 mer, were prepared, and all of their imino proton resonances of the complexes with lambda cro were assigned to individual base pairs. by monitoring the assigned signals of the dna fragments and lambda cro, it was found that in the complex of lambda cro with lambda or3, two subunits of the cro dimer bind to the right and left halves of the or3, respectively, and the bidentate binding induces a structural distortion in the middle of the 17 mer. lambda cro itself also undergoes a conformational change including loosening of the dimeric form. in the complex of lambda cro with phi 80 or2, which has a 6 bp sequence common to that of lambda or3, one subunit of the cro dimer seems to bind specifically to the common part. however, there is only a slight conformational change in the cro dimer. in the mixture of the crp binding site 22 mer and lambda cro, soft contact without any conformational change was observed between them.",1987,3297673,Base sequence-specific interactions of operator DNA fragments with the lambda-cro repressor coupled with changes in their conformations.
625,"although the primary genetic defect in all individuals with gaucher's disease is a deficiency in glucocerebrosidase activity, the finding of marked elevations in splenic and serum acid phosphatase activity is almost as consistent a finding. gaucher spleen and serum contain at least two forms of acid phosphatase that can be readily separated by chromatography on columns containing the cation exchange resin sulphopropyl sephadex. the major species of acid phosphatase (designated sp i) contained in triton x 100 (1% v/v) extracts of gaucher spleen accounts for 65%  95% of the total activity and has the following properties: (1) it does not bind to the cation exchange column; (2) it exhibitis a ph optimum of 4.5  5.0; (3) it is inhibited by sodium fluoride (15 mm), l(+) tartaric acid (20 mm), and beta mercaptoethanol (2.1 m), and (4) it is resistant to inhibition by sodium dithionite (10 mm). the minor acid phosphatase activity (designated sp ii) present in extracts of gaucher spleen has properties similar to those of the major species of acid phosphatase activity contained in serum from patients with gaucher's disease: (1) it binds firmly to cation exchange columns (eluted by 0.5 m sodium chloride); (2) it exhibits a ph optimum of 5.0  6.0; (3) it is inhibited by sodium fluoride and sodium dithionite; and (4) it is resistant to inhibition by beta mercaptoethanol (2.1 m) and l(+) tartaric acid (20 mm). in addition, a second form of acid phosphatase that is tartrate resistant was found to be elevated in gaucher serum. this form of serum acid phosphatase did not bind to sulphopropyl sephadex, was found to be significantly resistant to beta mercaptoethanol (2.1 m), and was only partially inhibited by sodium dithionite (10 mm). the findings reported here indicate that at least three distinct forms of acid phosphatase activity are elevated in gaucher's disease. furthermore, the minor acid phosphatase activity contained in spleen homogenates has properties very similar to those of the major acid phosphatase activity observed to be present in serum of patients with gaucher's disease. these data indicate that simple spleen spillage cannot account for the increased levels of serum acid phosphatase in patients with gaucher's disease.",1978,26832,Multiple forms of acid phosphatase activity in Gaucher's disease.
626,"regulation of gene expression via allosteric control of transcription is one of the fundamental concepts of molecular biology. studies in prokaryotes have illustrated that binding of small molecules or ligands to sequence specific transcription factors can produce conformational changes at a distance from the binding site. these ligand induced changes can dramatically alter the dna binding and/or trans activation abilities of the target transcription factors. in this work, analysis of trans activation by members of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily identifies a unique form of allosteric control, the phantom ligand effect. binding of a novel ligand (lg100754) to one subunit (rxr) of a heterodimeric transcription factor results in a linked conformational change in the second noncovalently bound subunit of the heterodimer (rar). this conformational change results in both the dissociation of corepressors and association of coactivators in a fashion mediated by the activation function of the non liganded subunit. without occupying the rar hormone binding pocket, binding of lg100754 to rxr mimics exactly the effects observed when hormone is bound to rar. thus, lg100754 behaves as a phantom ligand.",1997,9030683,The phantom ligand effect: allosteric control of transcription by the retinoid X receptor.

629,"the metabolic syndrome is associated with prolonged stress and hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and afflicted subjects are prone to develop cardiovascular disease. under normal conditions, the cardiomyocyte response to acute β adrenergic stimulation partly depends on increased production of reactive oxygen species (ros). here we investigated the interplay between beta adrenergic signaling, ros and cardiac contractility using freshly isolated cardiomyocytes and whole hearts from two mouse models with the metabolic syndrome (high fat diet and ob/ob mice). we hypothesized that cardiomyocytes of mice with the metabolic syndrome would experience excessive ros levels that trigger cellular dysfunctions. fluorescent dyes and confocal microscopy were used to assess mitochondrial ros production, cellular ca2+ handling and contractile function in freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes. immunofluorescence, western blot and enzyme assay were used to study protein biochemistry. unexpectedly, our results point towards decreased cardiac ros signaling in a stable, chronic phase of the metabolic syndrome because: β adrenergic induced increases in the amplitude of intracellular ca2+ signals were insensitive to antioxidant treatment; mitochondrial ros production showed decreased basal rate and smaller response to β adrenergic stimulation. moreover, control hearts and hearts with the metabolic syndrome showed similar basal levels of ros mediated protein modification, but only control hearts showed increases after β adrenergic stimulation. in conclusion, in contrast to the situation in control hearts, the cardiomyocyte response to acute β adrenergic stimulation does not involve increased mitochondrial ros production in a stable, chronic phase of the metabolic syndrome. this can be seen as a beneficial adaptation to prevent excessive ros levels.",2016,27907040,The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in β-Adrenergic Signaling in Cardiomyocytes from Mice with the Metabolic Syndrome.
630,"it is currently thought that nuclear pore complexes (npcs) primarily govern nucleocytoplasmic interactions via selective recognition and active transport of macromolecules. however, in various nuclear preparations, patch clamp and fluorescence, luminiscence and ion microscopy support classical microelectrode measurements indicating that monoatomic ion flow across the nuclear envelope (ne) is strictly regulated. gating of large conductance nuclear envelope ion channels (nics) somewhat resembles that of gap junctional channels. in other respects, nics are distinct in that they require cytosolic factors, are blocked by wheat germ agglutinin and are blocked and/or modified by antibodies to epitopes of npc glycoproteins. therefore, nic activity, recorded as electrical current/conductance is likely to be intrinsic to npcs. this observation suggests a potential use for the patch clamp technique in establishing the mechanisms underlying nuclear pore gating in response to cytosolic and nucleosolic factors such as transcription and growth factors, oncogene and proto oncogene products and receptors for retinoids, steroids and thyroid hormone. nic activity may also be useful in evaluating the mechanisms of nuclear import of foreign nucleic acid material such as that contained in virons and viroids. finally, in consideration to the electrophysiological data accumulated so far, the study of nuclear pore ion channel activity may help our understanding of other important issues such as cell suicide, programmed cell death or apoptosis.", ,7538009,Nuclear pore complex ion channels (review).

640,"remifentanil is used widely in clinical anesthesia because it induces more rapid and more common hyperalgesia than other opioid analgesics. activation of n methyl d aspartate (nmda) receptors takes a pivotal part in remifentanil induced hyperalgesia. like nmda receptors, the α amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (ampars) are excitatory ion glutamate receptors in postsynaptic membrane, which are involved in the transmission of both acute and chronic pain. protein interacting with c kinase 1 (pick1) plays an important role in nmda receptor mediated internalization of glutamate receptor 2 (glur2) containing ampars and contributes to the induction and maintenance of inflammation induced pain. this study aimed to test the hypothesis that pick1 contributes to remifentanil induced hyperalgesia by regulating ampar expression and trafficking in the spinal cord.
using a rat model of remifentanil induced hyperalgesia by intravenous infusion of remifentanil, we first measured changes in mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia at 24 hours before remifentanil infusion and 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours after infusion. pick1 mrna and protein expression and ampar subunit expression and trafficking in the spinal cord were then detected by reverse transcription qualitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. in addition, we knocked down pick1 expression by intrathecal administration of pick1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to investigate the effects of pick1 deficiency on remifentanil induced hyperalgesia and the expression and trafficking of ampars.
a significant time group interaction was found for nociceptive thresholds (paw withdrawal threshold and paw withdrawal latency; all p < .0001). remifentanil infusion induced distinct hyperalgesia at different time points (p < .0001), which was partly reversed by pick1 knockdown (p < .007). besides, remifentanil infusion increased the expression of pick1 mrna and protein (p < .0001) and the membrane glur1 and glur2 internalization in spinal dorsal horn neurons (p < .0011). more importantly, pick1 deficiency could attenuate remifentanil induced glur2 internalization in the spinal cord dorsal horn (p < .01) but had no effect on remifentanil induced membrane glur1 expression (p ≥ .985).

circulating naive and memory th cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in 60 patients with cirrhosis and 40 sex  and age matched healthy controls. thymopoiesis, apoptosis, cell activation, and proliferation were assessed through cd31, annexin v, hla dr and ki 67 expression, respectively. lipopolysaccharide (lps) binding protein (lbp) and spleen size were measured as indicators of bacterial translocation and splenic pooling, respectively.
compared to controls, patients showed reduced numbers of th cells involving a greater depletion of the naive than memory th cell compartment (2.7  vs. 1.5 fold, respectively). recent thymic emigrants were diminished (p < 0.01), and each patient had a lower number of cd31(+) naive th cells than the matched control. spontaneous and induced apoptosis (annexin v(+)) of th cells was increased in patients. activated (hla dr(+)) and proliferating (ki 67(+)) memory th cells were increased in patients (p < 0.01), and they directly correlated with plasma lbp (p < 0.05) and negatively with naive th cells (p < 0.01), respectively. naive th cells were inversely correlated (p < 0.01) with their frequencies of apoptosis and of activated memory th cells, lbp, and spleen size. on multivariate analysis, defective thymic generation of naive th cells, increased memory th cell activation, and splenomegaly were independently associated with th cell depletion.

687,"the aim of the present study was to evaluate the regulatory relationship between the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([ca2+]i and cytosolic ph (phi). [ca2+]i and phi were measured using the fluorescent dyes fura 2 and bcecf [2',7' bis (carboxyethyl) 5,6 carboxyfluorescein] respectively. in a medium with 1 mmol/l extracellular calcium, thrombin (2.5 units/ml) induced an increment in [ca2+]i of 638 +/  31 nmol/l (n = 5) and an intracellular alkalinization of 0.14 +/  0.01 ph units (n = 8). both responses were dependent on the concentration of thrombin, displaying a sigmoidal dose response pattern. the intracellular alkalinization was dependent upon extracellular na+ and was amiloride sensitive, indicating that it was mediated by activation of the na+/h+ exchanger. when extracellular calcium was chelated with egta prior to the addition of thrombin, the intracellular alkalinization was not affected (0.15 +/  0.02 at 2.5 units/ml thrombin, n = 8). under these circumstances, the [ca2+]i increment represents mobilization from internal stores, reaching 157 +/  42 nmol/l at 2.5 units/ml thrombin. when platelets were preloaded with the intracellular calcium chelator maptam (1,2 bis 5 methylaminophenoxylethane nnn' tetraacetoxymethyl acetate) to block the increase in [ca2+]i induced by thrombin, no increment in phi was observed. moreover, maptam loaded calcium depleted platelets had a basal phi that was more acidic than in the presence of 1 mmol/l extracellular calcium (6.93 +/  0.09 versus 7.14 +/  0.01, n = 26, p < 0.001). ionomycin induced an elevation of [ca2+]i that was accompanied by a concomitant increase in phi, which was na(+) dependent and amiloride sensitive. [ca2+]i and phi increases induced by ionomycin were both dependent on the concentration of ionomycin. in conclusion, an increase in [ca2+]i is necessary for the agonist induced activation of the na+/h+ exchanger in platelets. non agonist induced increases in [ca2+]i seems to prompt activation of the exchanger. in addition, ca(2+) depleted platelets have a more acidic basal phi, indicating that the basal level of [ca2+]i is also important for maintaining the basal phi.",1993,8383969,Intracellular calcium mobilization and activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in platelets.

717,"in order to investigate the relationship between the rate of protein protein electron transfer and the structure of the association complex, a dimer of the blue copper protein azurin was constructed and its electron exchange properties were determined. for this purpose, a site for covalent cross linking was engineered by replacing the surface exposed asparagine 42 with a cysteine. this mutation enabled the formation of disulfide linked homo dimers of azurin. based on nmr line broadening experiments, the electron self exchange (e.s.e.) rate constant for this dimer was determined to be 4.2(+/ 0.7) x 10(5)m( 1)s( 1), which is a seven fold decrease relative to wild type azurin. this difference is ascribed to a less accessible hydrophobic patch in the dimer. to discriminate between intramolecular electron transfer within a dimer and intermolecular electron transfer between two dimers, the e.s.e. rate constant of (cu cu) n42c dimers was compared with that of (zn cu)  and (ag cu) n42c dimers. as zn and ag are redox inactive, the intramolecular electron transfer reaction in these latter dimers can be eliminated. the e.s.e. rate constants of the three dimers are the same and an upper limit for the intramolecular electron transfer rate of 10 s( 1) could be determined. this rate is compatible with a cu cu distance of 18 a or more, which is larger than the cu   cu distance of 15 a observed in the wild type crystal structure that shows two monomers that face each other with opposing hydrophobic patches. modelling of the dimer shows that the cu cu distance should be in the range of 17 a < rcu cu < 28 a, which is in agreement with the experimental findings. for efficient electron transfer, it appears crucial that the two molecules interact in the proper orientation. direct cross linking may disturb the formation of such an optimal electron transfer complex.",2001,11446642,Effects of dimerization on protein electron transfer.
718,"alpha 4 integrins mediate cell cell and cell extracellular matrix interactions that are critical for maturation and function of the immune system as well as differentiation of skeletal muscle. here we examine molecular mechanisms controlling the pattern of alpha 4 expression. the activity of constructs containing 5' deletion mutants of the alpha 4 gene promoter was compared in transfection assays into cell lines that express alpha 4 and cell lines that do not. the sequence between position  42 and  76 base pairs (bp) was required for efficient transcription in cells that express alpha 4, but it showed no activity in hela cells, which do not express alpha 4. three binding sites for the ets family of transcription factors are found in this region: two adjacent sites at positions  50 and  54 bp and a more 5' site at position  67 bp. using a series of constructs containing deletions and mutations in this region, we found that the 3' most site alone was sufficient for binding ga binding protein alpha (gabp alpha)/gabp beta and for a low level of transcriptional activation. when all three sites were present, a second complex ""a"" was detected, which contains an unknown member of the ets family. formation of complex a was cell type specific and correlated with a high level of transcription. deletion of the 5' most ets site had no effect on binding to gabp alpha/gabp beta, but it eliminated a. concomitant with this loss of a, a new ets 1 containing complex ""c"" appeared. complex c substituted efficiently for complex a in transcriptional activation. we conclude that although neither of the two 5' most ets sites alone binds nuclear protein, they appear to act as modulators which control the pattern of ets proteins that bind the alpha 4 gene promoter. this arrangement of ets sites, coupled with the tissue  and developmental specific expression of ets members, likely play a key role in defining the pattern of alpha 4 integrin.",1994,8195215,An intricate arrangement of binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors regulates activity of the alpha 4 integrin gene promoter.

728,"a popular thermal stability assay developed especially for the study of membrane proteins uses a thiol specific probe, 7 diethylamino 3 (4 maleimidophenyl) 4 methylcoumarin (cpm). the fluorescence emission of cpm surges when it forms a covalent bond with the side chain of a free cys, which becomes more readily accessible upon protein thermal denaturation. interestingly, the melting temperatures of membrane proteins determined using the cpm assay in literature are closely clustered in the temperature range 45 55 °c. a thorough understanding of the mechanism behind the observed signal change is critical for the accurate interpretation of the protein unfolding. here we used two α helical membrane proteins, aqpz and acrb, as model systems to investigate the nature of the fluorescence surge in the cpm assay. we found that the transition temperatures measured using circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopy and the cpm assay were significantly different. to eliminate potential artifact that might arise from the presence of detergent, we monitored the unfolding of two soluble proteins. we found that, contrary to current understanding, the presence of a sulfhydryl group was not a prerequisite for the cpm thermal stability assay. the observed fluorescence increase is probably caused by binding of the fluorophore to hydrophobic patches exposed upon protein unfolding.

749,"sprouty (spry) proteins modulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and, thereby, regulate cell migration and proliferation. here, we have examined the role of endogenous human spry2 (hspry2) in the regulation of cellular apoptosis. small inhibitory rna mediated silencing of hspry2 abolished the anti apoptotic action of serum in adrenal cortex adenocarcinoma (sw13) cells. silencing of hspry2 decreased serum  or epidermal growth factor (egf) elicited activation of akt and erk1/2 and reduced the levels of egf receptor. silencing of hspry2 also inhibited serum induced activation of p90rsk and decreased phosphorylation of pro apoptotic protein bad (bcl2 antagonist of cell death) by p90rsk. inhibiting both the erk1/2 and akt pathways abolished the ability of serum to protect against apoptosis, mimicking the effects of silencing hspry2. serum transactivated the egf receptor (egfr), and inhibition of the egfr by a neutralizing antibody attenuated the anti apoptotic actions of serum. consistent with the role of egfr and perhaps other growth factor receptors in the anti apoptotic actions of serum, the tyrosine kinase binding domain of c cbl (cbl tkb) protected against down regulation of the growth factor receptors such as egfr and preserved the anti apoptotic actions of serum when hspry2 was silenced. additionally, silencing of spry2 in c cbl null cells did not alter the ability of serum to promote cell survival. moreover, reintroduction of wild type hspry2, but not its mutants that do not bind c cbl or cin85 into sw13 cells after endogenous hspry2 had been silenced, restored the anti apoptotic actions of serum. overall, we conclude that endogenous hspry2 mediated regulation of apoptosis requires c cbl and is manifested by the ability of hspry2 to sequester c cbl and thereby augment signaling via growth factor receptors.",2008,18070883,A novel role of Sprouty 2 in regulating cellular apoptosis.

760,"1. tardive dyskinesia (td), a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary hyperkinetic disorder occurring in 20   40% of the patient population undergoing chronic neuroleptic treatment is a major limitation of neuroleptic therapy. 2. oxidative stress and products of lipid peroxidation are implicated in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders including tardive dyskinesia. 3. chronic treatment with neuroleptics leads to the development of abnormal oral movements in rats known as vacuous chewing movements (vcms). vacuous chewing movements in rats are widely accepted as an animal model of tardive dyskinesia. 4. all the antipsychotics were administered i.p. once daily for 21 days, whereas carvedilol (also i.p.) was administered twice daily. rats chronically treated with haloperidol (1.0 mg kg( 1)) or chlorpromazine (5 mg kg( 1)) but not clozapine (2 mg kg( 1)) significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions. carvedilol dose dependently (0.5   2 mg kg( 1)) reduced the haloperidol or chlorpromazine induced vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions. 5. biochemical analysis revealed that chronic haloperidol or chlorpromazine but not clozapine treatment significantly induced lipid peroxidation and decreased the glutathione (gsh) levels in the forebrains of rats. chronic haloperidol or chlorpromazine but not clozapine treated rats showed decreased forebrain levels of antioxidant defence enzymes, superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase. 6. co administration of carvedilol (0.5 2 mg kg( 1)) significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and restored the decreased glutathione levels by chronic haloperidol or chlorpromazine treatment. co administration of carvedilol (1 2 mg kg( 1)) significantly reversed the haloperidol or chlorpromazine induced decrease in forebrain sod and catalase levels in rats. however, lower dose of carvedilol (0.5 mg kg( 1)) failed to reverse chronic haloperidol or chlorpromazine induced decrease in forebrain sod and catalase levels. 7. the major findings of the present study suggest that oxidative stress might play a significant role in neuroleptic induced orofacial dyskinesia. in conclusion, carvedilol could be a useful drug for the treatment of neuroleptic induced orofacial dyskinesia.",2002,12010767,Carvedilol attenuates neuroleptic-induced orofacial dyskinesia: possible antioxidant mechanisms.
761,"mitochondrial dysfunction is key feature of septic shock and contributes to the development of sepsis related organ dysfunction. it is characterized by a variable reduction of the respiratory chain (rc) activities, altered mitochondrial morphology and reactive oxygen species production. recent data have reported the efficacy of levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer, in improving heart performance and organ perfusion in critically ill patients. moreover, it has been demonstrated that levosimendan has antioxidant properties. nevertheless, the effects of levosimendan on mitochondrial function are not fully elucidated. the objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of levosimendan on mitochondria performance. five mitochondrial parameters were screened: the redox status; the amount of scavenging enzymes; the activities of the rc complexes; the mitochondrial content; the steady state levels of the rc subunits; the mitochondrial biogenesis. our results show that patients treated with levosimendan had a significant reduction of glutathionylated proteins and an increase in the amount of the antioxidant enzyme mnsod, underlining its antioxidant properties. the activities of the rc complexes i, ii and iii were unchanged in the mitochondria of patients treated with levosimendan compared to controls whereas the mitochondrial content was significantly higher in levosimendan vs. control patients. finally, evaluation of mitochondrial biogenesis did not show any significant difference in the two groups, although an overall increase in the amount of the rc subunits was observed in the levosimendan group. in conclusion, our study demonstrated that in septic shock patients, levosimendan exerts antioxidant action by increasing antioxidant defense and lowering oxidative damage.",2014,24657218,Effects of levosimendan on mitochondrial function in patients with septic shock: a randomized trial.

764,"the compound ly303511 (ly30) has been proven to induce production of ros and to sensitize cancer cells to trail induced apoptosis, but the mechanisms and mediators of ly30 induced effects are potentially complex. bayesian networks are a modelling technique for making probabilistic inferences about complex networks of uncertain causality.
fluorescent indicators for ros, reactive nitrogen species (rns), and free calcium were measured in time series after ly30 treatment. this ""correlative"" dataset was used as input for bayesian modelling to predict the causal dependencies among the measured species. predictions were compared against a separate ""causal"" dataset, in which cells had been treated with fetpps to scavenge peroxynitrite, egta am to chelate calcium, and tiron to scavenge o(2)( ). finally, cell viability measurements were integrated into an extended model of ly30 effects.
ly30 treatment caused a rapid increase of ros (measured by dcfda) as well as a significant increase in rns and calcium. bayesian modelling predicted that ca(2+)was a partial cause of the ros induced by short incubations with ly30, and that rns was strongly responsible for the ros induced by long incubations with ly30. validation experiments confirmed the predicted roles of rns and calcium, and also demonstrated a causal role for o(2)( ). in cell viability experiments, the additive effects of calcium and peroxynitrite were responsible for 90% of ly30 mediated sensitization to trail induced apoptosis.
we conclude that ly30 induces interdependent pathways of reactive species and stress signalling, with peroxynitrite and calcium contributing most significantly to apoptosis sensitization.",2012,22982511,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, in Bayesian network modelling of HeLa cell response to LY303511."

771,"in the past, segments were defined by landmarks such as muscle attachments, notably by snodgrass, the king of insect anatomists. here, we show how an objective definition of a segment, based on developmental compartments, can help explain the dorsal abdomen of adult drosophila. the anterior (a) compartment of each segment is subdivided into two domains of cells, each responding differently to hedgehog. the anterior of these domains is non neurogenic and clones lacking notch develop normally; this domain can express stripe and form muscle attachments. the posterior domain is neurogenic and clones lacking notch do not form cuticle; this domain is unable to express stripe or form muscle attachments. the posterior (p) compartment does not form muscle attachments. our in vivo films indicate that early in the pupa the anterior domain of the a compartment expresses stripe in a narrowing zone that attracts the extending myotubes and resolves into the attachment sites for the dorsal abdominal muscles. we map the tendon cells precisely and show that all are confined to the anterior domain of a. it follows that the dorsal abdominal muscles are intersegmental, spanning from one anterior domain to the next. this view is tested and supported by clones that change cell identity or express stripe ectopically. it seems that growing myotubes originate in posterior a and extend forwards and backwards until they encounter and attach to anterior a cells. the dorsal adult muscles are polarised in the anteroposterior axis: we disprove the hypothesis that muscle orientation depends on genes that define planar cell polarity in the epidermis.",2012,22147953,The muscle pattern of the Drosophila abdomen depends on a subdivision of the anterior compartment of each segment.
772,"to clarify the mechanisms underlying cell cycle promotion in malignant germ cell tumours of the ovary (mgctos), beta catenin and components of the prb pathway, cyclin d1 and p16, were analysed in relation to cell proliferation. immunohistochemically, p16 protein was not expressed in a number of mgctos (9 of 42 tumours: 21.4%) and was associated with p16 gene (ink4a) promoter 5' cpg islands methylation. amplification of the cyclin d1 gene (ccnd1) was detected in a small number of mgctos (5 of 42 tumours: 13.5%). reduced expression of p16 due to promoter methylation correlated significantly with increased cell proliferation as evidenced by ki 67 labelling index (p < 0.001) and mitotic index (p < 0.01). in some tumour types, nuclear localization of beta catenin has been reported to be associated with beta catenin gene (ctnnb1) mutation, cyclin d1 overexpression, and increased cell proliferation. nuclear localization of beta catenin, which was observed in mgctos other than dysgerminoma, was not associated with cyclin d1 expression and increased cell proliferation, but appeared to be related to tumour differentiation. furthermore, ctnnb1 mutations were not detected in any of the mgctos examined. our results suggest that reduced expression of p16 due to ink4a promoter methylation is one of the principal factors that promote cell proliferation in mgctos. thus, p16 may be a novel target for gene therapies to treat mgctos.",2004,15476271,Significance of beta-catenin and pRB pathway components in malignant ovarian germ cell tumours: INK4A promoter CpG island methylation is associated with cell proliferation.

788,"the present study tested the hypothesis that acute melatonin treatment affects the biological clock mechanism controlling the circadian melatonin rhythm. adult djungarian hamsters were raised in ld 16:8 (lights on from 0300 to 1900 hr). pineal and serum melatonin concentrations were assessed at specific clock times during the subsequent ld cycle (day 1) and afterwards in hamsters that remained in constant darkness (day 2), to assess the effects of treatment on the circadian melatonin rhythm. in untreated controls (n = 76), melatonin increased in the pineal and in circulation within the first hour after lights off (day 1) or subjective night (day 2); melatonin concentrations remained elevated for up to 7 hr. a single melatonin injection (5 micrograms/0.2 ml saline, s.c.), administered in the morning (0900 hr, n = 80) or late afternoon (1600 hr, n = 74), transiently increased in circulation but not in the pineal gland. in constant darkness (day 2), the circadian melatonin rhythm in both the pineal gland and circulation was the same as that in untreated controls. no significant differences were found among the three groups in the mean concentration during the day or night; the rise, fall, peak time, peak amplitude, and duration of increased melatonin were also unchanged. the ability of melatonin to override the effect of a light pulse on the circadian melatonin rhythm was also tested. the 5 min light pulse at night (2300 2305 hr of day 1, n = 64) delayed the rise and shortened the duration of increased melatonin in both pineal gland and serum by as much as 3 hr (day 2); these light effects were more pronounced on the pineal than on the serum melatonin rhythm. injection with melatonin prior to the light pulse (5 micrograms/0.2 ml saline at 2245 hr, n = 64) failed to alter the inhibitory effects of light on the circadian melatonin rhythm. these data suggest that the biological clock mechanism controlling the circadian melatonin rhythm in the djungarian hamster in long days is responsive to the phase shifting effects of light, but resistant to the influence of acute melatonin treatment.",1994,7949308,Influence of acute melatonin treatment and light on the circadian melatonin rhythm in the Djungarian hamster.
789,"nitric oxide (no) relaxes vascular smooth muscle by increasing the intracellular concentration of cgmp. in the pulmonary circulation, cgmp is inactivated by specific phosphodiesterases (pde5). dipyridamole, a clinically approved drug, has inhibitory activity against pde5 and has been reported to augment the response to inhaled no in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (pphn). we wished to determine whether dipyridamole alone, or in combination with no, can be used to treat a newborn lamb model of pphn. in newborn lambs with pphn, dipyridamole infused at 0.02 mg/kg/min for 45 min alone, or in combination with 5 ppm of inhaled no for the final 15 min, significantly decreased pulmonary and systemic blood pressure, decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased pulmonary blood flow. there was no significant difference between the pulmonary vascular effects of 5 ppm no alone compared with the effects of no combined with dipyridamole. in control lambs, the 45 min infusion of dipyridamole did not change pulmonary pressure whereas systemic pressure decreased by 28 +/  3%. these systemic effects in control lambs persisted 90 min after discontinuing the dipyridamole infusion. systemic arteries isolated from both control and pphn lambs were significantly more sensitive to dipyridamole than pulmonary arteries. we conclude that dipyridamole has significant hemodynamic effects in both the pulmonary and systemic circulations of newborn lambs with pulmonary hypertension as well as in the systemic circulation of newborn control lambs. the pronounced effects of dipyridamole on the systemic circulation limits its utility as an adjunct to inhaled no in the treatment of pphn.",1998,9853914,Pulmonary and systemic effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor dipyridamole in newborn lambs with persistent pulmonary hypertension.

795,"to investigate whether hypercoagulability plays a role in thrombus formation in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (crvo) who are less than 56 years of age.
prospective, observational case series with retrospective comparative controls.
participants included 55 consecutive patients with crvo less than 56 years of age. the laboratory's age matched control groups were used to compare results for the same tests.
fifty five patients with crvo less than 56 years old (mean age, 44 years) underwent laboratory evaluation for homocysteine, activated protein c resistance, protein c activity, protein s activity, antithrombin iii activity, antiphospholipid antibodies, and anticardiolipin antibodies. the results were compared with previously drawn age matched control groups obtained by the same laboratory for statistical significance.
patients were considered to have a positive test if their results were outside the laboratory's established range.
fifteen of 55 patients (27%) had one positive test result suggesting hypercoagulability. compared with the control groups, these patients less than 56 years old with crvo had a higher incidence of coagulation abnormalities by laboratory testing. among the parameters tested, hyperhomocysteinemia and circulating antiphospholipid antibodies were significantly more common in the crvo patients (p < 0.05) compared with age matched controls.
hypercoagulability may play a role in the pathogenesis of crvo in patients less than 56 years old. the cause of crvo remains multifactorial, and laboratory tests suggesting hypercoagulable states alone cannot account for the cause in most of these patients less than 56 years of age. the authors recommend examining blood pressure, intraocular pressure, complete blood count, glucose levels, and a lipid panel on all patients with crvo. when tests for these common risk factors for crvo are negative, consider ordering selected tests in young patients with crvo to rule out thrombophilias, especially in patients with bilateral crvo, a history of previous thrombosis, or family history of thrombosis.",2002,11772591,Laboratory evaluation of hypercoagulable states in patients with central retinal vein occlusion who are less than 56 years of age.

a human glioma cell line m059j lacking the catalytic subunit of dna pk (dna pkcs) and its dna pkcs proficient counterpart, m059k, were exposed to 1 and 4 gy of accelerated nitrogen ions (14n, 140 ev nm( 1), 8 12 gy min( 1)) or 60co gamma rays (0.2 ev nm( 1), 0.7 gy min( 1)). the induction of apoptosis was studied up to 144 h post irradiation using two different methods: morphological characterization of apoptotic cells after fluorescent staining and cell size distribution analysis to detect apoptotic bodies. in parallel, protein expression of dna pkcs and poly(adp ribose) polymerase (parp) as well as dna pk and caspase 3 activity were investigated.
low and high let radiations (4 gy) induced a time dependent apoptotic response in both cell lines. low let radiation induced a significantly elevated apoptotic response in m059j as compared with m059k cells at 144 h post irradiation. following high let radiation exposure, there was no difference between the cell lines at this time. parp cleavage was detected in m059j cells following both low and high let irradiation, while only high let radiation induced parp cleavage in m059k cells. these cleavages occurred in the absence of caspase 3 activation.

822,"the cell is able to regulate which genes to express via chemical marks on the dna and on the histone proteins. in all vertebrates, the modification on the dna is methylation at position 5 of the two cytosines present in the dinucleotide sequence cpg. the information encoded by these chemical marks on the dna is processed by a family of protein factors containing a conserved methyl cpg binding domain (mbd). essential to their function, the mbd proteins are able to bind dna containing dimethylated cpg sites, whereas binding to unmethylated sites is not observed. in this paper, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanism by which the mcpg binding domain of mbd1 is able to bind specifically dimethylated cpg sites. we find that the binding affinity of mbd1 to a dna containing dimethylated cpg site is stronger by 26.4 kj/mol relative to binding the same dna but with an unmethylated cpg site. the contribution of each of the methyl groups to the change in free energy is very similar and additive. therefore, this binding affinity (to a dimethylated dna) is halved when considered relative to binding a hemimethylated dna, a result that is also supported by experimental observations. despite their equal contributions, the two methyl groups are recognized differently by mbd1. in one case, demethylation induces conformational changes in which the hydrophobic patch formed by the conserved residues val20, arg22, and tyr34 moves away from the (methyl)cytosine, weakening the dna protein interactions. this is accompanied by an intrusion of a bulk water into the binding site at the protein dna interface. as a consequence, there is a reduction and rearrangements of the protein dna hydrogen bonds including a loss of a crucial hydrogen bond between tyr34 and the (methyl)cytosine. the methylcytosine on the opposite strand is recognized by conformational changes of the surrounding conserved hydrophobic residues, arg44 and ser45, in which arg44 participate in the 5mc arg g triad. more specifically, the hydrogens of the methyl group form weak hydrogen bonds with the guanidino group and backbone carbonyl of the conserved arg44, interactions that are absent when the cytosine is unmethylated. the results presented in this paper contribute to our knowledge of the different ways the chemical mark on the dna is recognized by the epigenetic machinery.

we performed literature searches from january 2010 to 18 november 2016 for new randomized controlled trials (rcts) of micronutrient supplements since the previous review included all trials identified from searches prior to 2010. we searched the central (the cochrane library), embase, and pubmed databases. also we checked the world health organization (who) international clinical trials registry platform (ictrp) and the clinicaltrials.gov trials registers. we also checked the reference lists of all new included trials.
we included rcts that compared supplements that contained either single, dual, or multiple micronutrients with placebo, no treatment, or other supplements. we excluded studies that were primarily designed to investigate the role of micronutrients for the treatment of hiv positive participants with metabolic morbidity related to highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). primary outcomes included all cause mortality, morbidity, and disease progression.

877,"it has been shown that the addition of a beta adrenergic catecholamine to a trout red blood cell suspension induces a 60 100 fold increase of sodium permeability resulting from the activation of a camp dependent na+/h+ antiport. subsequent addition of propranolol almost instantaneously reduces the intracellular camp concentration, and thus the na permeability, to their basal values (mahé et al., 1985). if glutaraldehyde (0.06 0.1%) is added when the na+/h+ exchanger is activated after hormonal stimulation, addition of propranolol no longer inhibits na permeability: once activated and fixed by glutaraldehyde, the camp dependence disappears. glutaraldehyde alone causes a rapid decrease in the cellular camp concentration. in its fixed state the antiporter is fully amiloride sensitive. the switching on of the na+/h+ exchange by camp is rapidly (2 min) followed by acute but progressive desensitization of the exchanger (garcia romeu et al., 1988). the desensitization depends on the concentration of external sodium, being maximal at a normal na concentration (145 mm) and nonexistent at a low na concentration (20 mm). if glutaraldehyde is added after activation in nondesensitizing conditions (20 mm na), transfer to a na rich medium induces only a very slight desensitization: thus the fixative can ""freeze"" the exchanger in the nondesensitizing conformation. no3  inhibits the activity of the camp dependent na+/h+ antiporter of the trout red blood cell (borgese et al., 1986). if glutaraldehyde is added when the cells are activated by camp in a chloride containing medium, the activity of the exchanger is no longer inhibited when cl  is replaced by no3 . conversely, after fixation in no3  medium replacement of no3  by cl  has very little stimulatory effect. this indicates that the anion dependence is not a specific requirement for the exchange process but that the anion environment is critical for the switching on of the na+/h+ exchanger and for the maintenance of its activated configuration.",1989,2552001,Glutaraldehyde fixation of the cAMP-dependent Na+/H+ exchanger in trout red cells.

879,"many eukaryotic proteins are tethered to the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi). gpi transamidase is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and mediates post translational transfer of preformed gpi to proteins bearing a carboxyl terminal gpi attachment signal. mammalian gpi transamidase is a multimeric complex consisting of at least five subunits. here we report that two subunits of mammalian gpi transamidase, gpi8 and pig t, form a functionally important disulfide bond between conserved cysteine residues. gpi8 and pig t mutants in which relevant cysteines were replaced with serines were unable to fully restore the surface expression of gpi anchored proteins upon transfection into their respective mutant cells. microsomal membranes of these transfectants had markedly decreased activities in an in vitro transamidase assay. the formation of this disulfide bond is not essential but required for full transamidase activity. antibodies against gpi8 and pig t revealed that endogenous as well as exogenous proteins formed a disulfide bond. furthermore trypanosome gpi8 forms a similar intermolecular disulfide bond via its conserved cysteine residue, suggesting that the trypanosome gpi transamidase is also a multimeric complex likely containing the orthologue of pig t. we also demonstrate that an inactive human gpi transamidase complex that consists of non functional gpi8 and four other components was co purified with the proform of substrate proteins, indicating that these five components are sufficient to hold the substrate proteins.",2003,12582175,"Two subunits of glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase, GPI8 and PIG-T, form a functionally important intermolecular disulfide bridge."

882,"the orientation of lipoteichoic acid (lta) molecules on the surface of bacterial cells undoubtedly is determined by the ability of the lta, during its transit through the cell wall, to bind via its polyglycerophosphate backbone or its glycolipid moieties to other constituents of the cytoplasmic membrane and the cell wall. we have investigated the possibility that lta may become anchored to the cell surface by binding through its polyanionic backbone to positively charged regions of cell wall proteins. lta was found to prevent the precipitation of partially purified hcl extracts of several strains of streptococci as well as a structurally defined streptococcal m protein molecule (pep m24) in 83% solutions of ethanol. the formation of complexes between lta and m protein was demonstrated further by immunoelectrophoresis of pep m24 protein with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled lta and by using antiserum against pep m24 to develop precipitin arcs. pep m24 electrophoresed alone produced a single precipitin arc close to the origin. in contrast, when electrophoresed as a mixture with lta or deacylated lta, the m protein produced a second precipitin arc toward the anode coinciding with the area of migration of the radioactive lta. increasing concentrations of lta or deacylated lta shifted increasing amounts of the pep m24 antigen to the region of the second arc. maleylation of m protein to block the positively charged free amino groups before mixing it with lta prevented the formation of complexes. the complexes formed by the m protein with lta, but not with deacylated lta, showed the capacity to bind bovine serum albumin; lta had been shown previously to bind to the fatty acid binding sites on bovine serum albumin. these results indicate that the lta molecule is able to bind via its polyanionic backbone to positively charged residues of surface proteins of cells of s. pyogenes. the implications of such interaction as to the orientation of lta molecules on the surface of cells of s. pyogenes are discussed.",1982,7035430,Formation of molecular complexes between a structurally defined M protein and acylated or deacylated lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus pyogenes.

893,"previous studies suggest that nitric oxide (no) is involved in headaches induced by i.v. infusion of the vasodilator and no donor glyceryl trinitrate (gtn) in healthy subjects. extending these studies to sufferers of migraine without aura, it was found that migraineurs experienced a stronger headache than non migraineurs. in addition, most migraineurs experienced a delayed migraine attack at variable times (mean 5.5 h) after gtn provocation. this biphasic headache response in migraineurs may be linked to hypersensitivity in the no cgmp pathway. thus, compared to controls, migraineurs were found to be more sensitive to gtn induced intracranial arterial dilatation, which is known to be mediated via liberation of no and subsequent synthesis of cgmp furthermore, histamine infusions in migraineurs induced headache responses and intracranial arterial responses resembling those induced by gtn in migraineurs. histamine is known to liberate no from the endothelium via stimulation of the h1 receptor, which is present in the large intracranial arteries in man. because both immediate histamine induced headache and intracranial arterial dilatation and delayed histamine induced migraine are blocked by h1 receptor blockade, a likely common pathway for gtn and histamine induced headaches/migraines and intracranial arterial responses may be via activation of the no cgmp pathway. the delay in the development of these experimental migraines may reflect activation of multiple physiological processes. the intracranial arteries of migraineurs were found supersensitive to the vasodilating effect of gtn (exogenous no). this relates to clinical findings suggesting dilatation of the large intracranial arteries on the headache side during spontaneous migraine attacks. the function of arterial regulatory mechanisms involving no in migraine was therefore studied. in peripheral arteries, no endothelial dysfunction of no was found and cardiovascular and intracranial arterial sympathetic function was normal. a mild parasympathetic dysfunction may be involved and may, via denervation supersensitivity, be responsible for the observed supersensitivity to no. another possibility is that no initiates a perivascular neurogenic inflammation with liberation of vasoactive peptides. no also mediates a variety of other physiological phenomena. one of these, the pain modulating effect observed in animals, was evaluated in a human study using gtn infusion and measurements of pain thresholds. no definite effects of gtn were demonstrated. the precise mechanisms involved in no triggered migraines and which part of the no activated cascade that is involved remain to be determined. the possibilities for pharmacological stimulation and/or inhibition of several steps of the no activated cascade increase rapidly and soon may be available for human studies.",1997,9453277,Investigations into the role of nitric oxide and the large intracranial arteries in migraine headache.

897,"the mechanisms by which protein kinase c (pkc) and extracellular signal regulated kinases (erk1/2) govern smooth muscle contractility remain unclear. calponin (cap), an actin binding protein and pkc substrate, mediates signaling through erk1/2. we report here that cap sequences containing the cap homology (ch) domain bind to the c terminal 251 amino acids of smooth muscle archvillin (smav), a new splice variant of supervillin, which is a known actin  and myosin ii binding protein. the cap smav interaction is demonstrated by reciprocal yeast two hybrid and blot overlay assays and by colocalization in cos 7 cells. in differentiated smooth muscle, endogenous smav and cap co fractionate and co translocate to the cell cortex after stimulation by agonist. antisense knockdown of smav in tissue inhibits both the activation of erk1/2 and contractions stimulated by either agonist or pkc activation. this erk1/2 signaling and contractile defect is similar to that observed in cap knockdown experiments. in a7r5 smooth muscle cells, pkc activation by phorbol esters induces the reorganization of endogenous, membrane localized smav and microfilament associated cap into podosome like structures that also contain f actin, nonmuscle myosin iib and erk1/2. these results indicate that smav contributes to the regulation of contractility through a cap mediated signaling pathway, involving pkc activation and phosphorylation of erk1/2.",2004,15383618,Smooth muscle archvillin: a novel regulator of signaling and contractility in vascular smooth muscle.
898,"ps (presenilin) dependent gamma secretase occurs as a high molecular mass complex composed of either ps1 or ps2 associated with nct (nicastrin), pen2 (presenilin enhancer 2 homologue) and aph1 (anterior pharynx defective 1 homologue). numerous reports have documented the very complicated physical and functional cross talk between these proteins that ultimately governs the biological activity of the gamma secretase, but very few studies examined the fate of the components of the complex. we show that, in both hek 293 cells and the tsm1 neuronal cell line, the immunoreactivities of overexpressed myc tagged aph1a and  pen2 were enhanced by the proteasome inhibitors zie and lactacystin, whereas a broad range of protease inhibitors had no effect. by contrast, proteasome inhibitors were totally unable to affect the cellular expression of endogenous aph1al and pen2 in hek 293 cells, tsm1 and primary cultured cortical neurons. to explain this apparent discrepancy, we examined the degradation of myc tagged aph1a and  pen2, in vitro, by cell extracts containing endogenous proteasome and by purified 20s proteasome. strikingly, myc tagged aph1a and  pen2 resist proteolysis by endogenous proteasome and purified 20s proteasome. we also show that endogenous pen2 expression was drastically higher in wild type than in ps  and nct deficient fibroblasts and was enhanced by proteasome inhibitors only in the two deficient cell systems. however, here again, purified 20s proteasome appeared unable to cleave endogenous pen2 present in ps deficient fibroblasts. the levels of endogenous aph1al like immunoreactivity were not modified by proteasome inhibitors and were unaffected by ps deficiency. altogether, our results indicate that endogenous pen2 and aph1al do not undergo proteasomal degradation under physiological conditions in hek 293 cells, tsm1 cells and fibroblasts and that the clearance of pen2 in ps  and nct deficient fibroblasts is not mediated by 20s proteasome. whether the 26s proteasome participates to pen2 proteolysis in deficient fibroblasts remains to be established.",2006,16302845,Catabolism of endogenous and overexpressed APH1a and PEN2: evidence for artifactual involvement of the proteasome in the degradation of overexpressed proteins.

900,"rna helicases are involved in almost every aspect of rna, from transcription to rna decay. dexd/h box helicases comprise the largest sf2 helicase superfamily, which are characterized by two conserved reca like domains. in recent years, an increasing number of unexpected functions of these proteins have been discovered. they play important roles not only in innate immune response but also in diseases like cancers and chronic hepatitis c. in this review, we summarize the recent literatures on one member of the sf2 superfamily, the dead box protein ddx41. after bacterial or viral infection, dna or cyclic di gmp is released to cells. after phosphorylation of tyr414 by btk kinase, ddx41 will act as a sensor to recognize the invaders, followed by induction of type i interferons (ifn). after the immune response, ddx41 is degraded by the e3 ligase trim21, using lys9 and lys115 of ddx41 as the ubiquitination sites. besides the roles in innate immunity, ddx41 is also related to diseases. an increasing number of both inherited and acquired mutations in ddx41 gene are identified from myelodysplastic syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukemia (mds/aml) patients. the review focuses on ddx41, as well as its homolog abstrakt in drosophila, which is important for survival at all stages throughout the life cycle of the fly.",2017,27502187,The emerging roles of the DDX41 protein in immunity and diseases.
901,"a possible role of the nitric oxide (no)/cgmp pathway in the regulation of ca2+ entry into ht29/b6 human colonic epithelial cells was investigated using digital image processing of fura 2 fluorescence and immunoblotting for nitric oxide synthase (nos). we tested the hypothesis that ca2+ store depletion causes increased nos activity and [no], which is stimulatory to ca2+ entry by increasing guanylate cyclase (gc) and [cgmp]. cells were incubated in 95 mm k(+) containing solutions to depolarize the cell membrane potential and thereby exclude effects of no and cgmp on k+ or cl  channels, which might affect ca2+ entry. sodium nitroprusside (snp, 0.5 microm and 30 microm), a no donor, only slightly raised intracellular [ca2+] ([ca2+]i) in resting cells, but in 100 microm carbachol stimulated cells the sustained, elevated ca2+ plateau (reflecting ca2+ entry) as well as ba2+ entry were increased by 0.5 microm snp, while 5, 10 or 30 microm snp either had no effect or were inhibitory. pretreatment of cells with the nos inhibitor n nitro l arginine (1 mm) reduced carbachol stimulated ca2+ entry, and simultaneous treatment with 0.5 microm (but not 30 microm) snp restored ca2+ influx. 8 br cgmp (1 mm) had little effect on [ca2+]i or on rates of ca2+ or ba2+ influx into resting cells, but there were large effects on cells in which capacitative ca2+ entry was activated by carbachol or cyclopiazonic acid (10 microm). the gc inhibitor ly83583 (10 microm) reduced carbachol stimulated ca2+ entry, and this entry was restored with 8 br cgmp. western blotting revealed that endothelial type nos was present in the particulate fraction of cells. the data are consistent with the notion that ca2+ entry into ht29/b6 cells is regulated by endothelial nos/no and gc/cgmp, but effects are most pronounced in store depleted cells. thus, no and cgmp appear to potentiate the action of messengers released from the store during the emptying process, but no and cgmp have only small effects of their own to open the ca2+ channel in the plasma membrane. high [snp] appeared to be inhibitory while low [snp] was stimulatory, indicating that a precise range of [no] may be required for effective stimulation of ca2+ entry.",1995,7545090,Possible regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry into colonic epithelial cells by NO and cGMP.
902,"epidermal differentiation and stratification, crucial for barrier formation, are regulated by a complex interplay of transcription factors, including the evolutionarily conserved grainyhead like 3 (grhl3/get1); grhl3 deleted mice exhibit impaired epidermal differentiation and decreased expression of multiple differentiation genes. to test whether grhl3 regulates epidermal genes indirectly by controlling the expression of specific micrornas (mirs), we performed mir profiling and identified 11 mirs that are differentially regulated in grhl3( / ) skin, one of which is mir 21, previously shown to be upregulated in diseased skin, including in psoriasis and squamous cell skin cancer. we found that mir 21 is normally expressed in the post mitotic suprabasal layers of the epidermis, overlapping with grhl3. the mir 21 promoter is bound and repressed by grhl3 indicating that these two factors are involved in a regulatory loop maintaining homeostasis in the epidermis. although mir 21 overexpression in normal keratinocytes had mild effects on the expression of several known mir 21 targets, an enhanced downregulation of the mir 21 tumor related targets, including msh2, was observed in ras transformed keratinocytes. the increased sensitivity of transformed keratinocytes to mir 21's effects occurs in part through downregulation of the rna binding protein dnd1 during the transformation process. additionally, we observed increased tumorigenesis in mice subcutaneously injected with transformed keratinocytes lacking grhl3. these findings indicate that decreased grhl3 expression contributes to tumor progression and upregulation of the oncomir mir 21 in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.",2013,22614019,The Grainyhead transcription factor Grhl3/Get1 suppresses miR-21 expression and tumorigenesis in skin: modulation of the miR-21 target MSH2 by RNA-binding protein DND1.
903,"several key proteins have been localized to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum which are important for ca2+ release. these include the ryanodine receptor, triadin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane. we recently purified and cloned a fourth component of this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and is the major 125i calsequestrin binding protein detected in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (jones, l. r., zhang, l., sanborn, k., jorgensen, a. o., and kelley, j. (1995) j. biol. chem. 270, 30787 30796). in the present study, we have examined the binding interactions between the cardiac forms of these four proteins with emphasis placed on the role of junctin. by a combination of approaches including calsequestrin affinity chromatography, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor. this binding interaction is localized to the lumenal domain of junctin, which is highly enriched in charged amino acids organized into ""keke"" motifs. keke repeats are also found in the common lumenal domain of triadin, which likewise is capable of binding to calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (guo, w., and campbell, k. p. (1995) j. biol. chem. 270, 9027 9030). it appears that junctin and triadin interact directly in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and stabilize a complex that anchors calsequestrin to the ryanodine receptor. taken together, these results suggest that junctin, calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor form a quaternary complex that may be required for normal operation of ca2+ release.",1997,9287354,"Complex formation between junctin, triadin, calsequestrin, and the ryanodine receptor.

913,"our previous studies with the use of non selective cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitor, indomethacin, demonstrated that prostanoids produced during endotoxaemia increase inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) protein expression and nitric oxide synthesis, and decrease cyctochrome p450 (cyp) 4a1 protein expression and cyp 4a activity. the results suggest that dual inhibition of inos and cox by indomethacin restores blood pressure presumably due to increased production of 20 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20 hete) derived from cyp 4a in endotoxaemic rats. the present study examined whether increased levels of vasoconstrictor eicosanoids, 20 hete, prostaglandin f(2α) (pgf(2α) )and thromboxane a(2) (txa(2) ), would contribute to the effect of selective cox 2 inhibition to prevent endotoxin (et) induced fall in blood pressure associated with an increase in the production of vasodilator prostanoids, prostaglandin i(2) (pgi(2) ) and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2) ) and nitric oxide synthesis. mean arterial blood pressure fell by 31 mmhg and heart rate (hr) rose by 90 beats/min. in male wistar rats treated with et (10 mg/kg, i.p.). the fall in mean arterial pressure and increase in hr were associated with increased levels of 6 keto prostaglandin f(1α) (6 keto pgf(1α) ), pge(2) , txb(2) , and nitrite in the serum, kidney, heart, thoracic aorta and/or superior mesenteric artery. systemic and renal 20 hete and pgf(2α) levels were also decreased in endotoxaemic rats. these effects of et were prevented by a selective cox 2 inhibitor, n (2 cyclohexyloxy 4 nitrophenyl)methansulphonamide (10 mg/kg, i.p.), given 1 hr after injection of et. these data suggest that an increase in 20 hete and pgf(2α) levels associated with decreased production of pgi(2) , pge(2) , and txa(2) , and nitric oxide synthesis contributes to the effect of selective cox 2 inhibitor to prevent the hypotension during rat endotoxaemia.",2010,22545970,"Contribution of vasoactive eicosanoids and nitric oxide production to the effect of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, NS-398, on endotoxin-induced hypotension in rats."

c57bl/6j mice were randomly divided into seven groups, fed a regular diet or a high fat diet alone or supplemented with one of five agents: eugenosedin a, ketanserin, prazosin, propranolol or atorvastatin (5 mg/kg p.o.) for 8 weeks.
compared with the regular diet, the mice fed the high fat diet had significantly higher body weight and glucose, insulin and lipid levels. brain malondialdehyde concentration was increased and liver glutathione peroxidase activity decreased. addition of eugenosedin a to the high fat diet resulted in less weight gain and reduced hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia. lipid and glucose homeostasis were related to decreased hepatic lipogenesis mrnas and proteins (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1a, fatty acid synthase, sterol coa desaturase) and restored adipose peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma expression. eugenosedin a also enhanced low density lipoprotein receptor mrna expression.
eugenosedin a may improve plasma lipid metabolism by increasing low density lipoprotein receptor and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma expression and diminishing sterol regulatory element binding protein 1a, fatty acid synthase and sterol coa desaturase. reduction of plasma glucose and lipid levels may, in turn, reduce insulin concentration, which would explain the marked improvement in obesity related hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. furthermore, eugenosedin a affected malondialdehyde concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity, suggesting it may have anti peroxidation effects in mice fed a high fat diet.",2009,19298700,"Eugenosedin-A prevents hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and lipid peroxidation in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet."

922,"clofibric acid (ca) is metabolized to chemically reactive acylating products that can transacylate glutathione to form clofibryl s acyl glutathione (ca sg) in vitro and in vivo. we investigated the first step in the degradation of ca sg to the mercapturic acid conjugate, clofibryl s acyl n acetylcysteine (ca snac), which is catalyzed by gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma gt). after gamma gt mediated cleavage of glutamate from ca sg, the product clofibryl s acyl cysteinylglycine (ca s cg) should undergo an intramolecular rearrangement reaction [tate, s. s. (1975) febs lett. 54, 319 322] to form clofibryl n acyl cysteinylglycine (ca n cg). we performed in vitro studies incubating ca sg with gamma gt to determine the products formed, and in vivo studies examining the products excreted in urine after dosing rats with ca sg or ca. thus, ca sg (0.1 mm) was incubated with gamma gt (0.1 unit/ml) in buffer (ph 7.4, 25 degrees c) and analyzed for products formed by reversed phase hplc and electrospray mass spectrometry (esi/ms). results showed that ca sg is degraded completely after 6 h of incubation leading to the formation of two products, ca n cg and its disulfide, with no detection of ca s cg thioester. after 36 h of incubation, only the disulfide remained in the incubation. treatment of the disulfide with dithiothreitol led to the reappearance of ca n cg. esi/lc/ms analysis of urine (16 h) extracts of ca sg dosed rats (200 mg/kg, iv) showed that ca sg is degraded to ca n cg, ca n acyl cysteine (ca n c) and their respective s methylated products. the mercapturic acid conjugate (ca snac) was found as a minor product. analysis of urine extracts from ca dosed rats (200 mg/kg, ip) resulted in the detection of clofibryl n acyl cysteine (ca n c), but no evidence for the formation of ca snac was obtained. these in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that gamma gt mediated degradation of clofibryl s acyl glutathione leads primarily to the formation and excretion of clofibryl n acyl cysteine products rather than the s acyl nac conjugate.",2001,11511177,Interaction of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase with clofibryl-S-acyl-glutathione in vitro and in vivo in rat.

our findings suggest that the p27 109gg variant genotype may not play a major role in the etiology of scchn but may be associated with an increased risk in at risk subgroups or subsets of scchn, particularly oral cavity cancer and possibly tumor progression. larger studies with oral squamous cell carcinoma are needed to verify these findings.",2004,15217930,Association between the V109G polymorphism of the p27 gene and the risk and progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma.

946,"the purpose of the study was to determine whether along and in combination melatonin (mlt) and pentoxifylline (ptx) exerted beneficial effects on histopathological changes and changes in oxidant and antioxidant systems in liver caused by ccl4 induced liver toxicity in mice. mice were randomly divided into six groups: control, olive oil, toxicity, mlt, ptx, ptx+mlt. mlt 10 mg/kg/day, ptx 50 mg/kg/day, and the same individual doses in mlt+ptx combination were given intraperitoneally to mice for 7 day. ccl4 0.8 mg/kg/day was administered on the 4th, 5th, and 6th days of therapy in all groups except the control and olive oil groups. in the toxicity group, increased concentrations of malondialdehyde (mda) and lipid hydroperoxides (looh) and decreased glutathione peroxidase (gsh px) and catalase (cat) activities were found compared to the control and olive oil groups (p < 0.05). compared to the toxicity group, both the ptx group and the ptx+mlt group had decreased mda and looh levels, whereas mlt reduced only looh levels (p < 0.01). mlt, ptx and mlt+ptx increased the gsh px and cat activities compared to the toxicity group (p < 0.05). mlt increased cat activity compared to ptx and mlt+ptx (p < 0.05). superoxide dismutase enzyme activity did not change in any group (p < 0.05). histopathologically, ballooning, degeneration, apoptosis, and bridging necrosis were seen in the toxicity group. mlt, ptx and mlt+ptx decreased the apoptosis and bridging necrosis (p < 0.01), and ptx and mlt+ptx decreased balloon degeneration compared to the toxicity group (p < 0.01). these results indicate that administration of ptx and mlt alone and in combination before onset of liver toxicity might prevent the oxidative damage by reducing oxidative stress and increasing antioxidant enzyme levels.",2006,16703270,Comparison of the effects of melatonin and pentoxifylline on carbon tetrachloride-induced liver toxicity in mice.

948,"convergent morphologies often arise due to similar selective pressures in independent lineages. it is poorly understood whether the same or different developmental genetic mechanisms underlie such convergence. here we show that independent evolution of a reproductive trait, ovariole number, has resulted from changes in distinct developmental mechanisms, each of which may have a different underlying genetic basis in drosophila. ovariole number in drosophila is species specific, highly variable, and largely under genetic control. convergent changes in drosophila ovariole number have evolved independently within and between species. we previously showed that the number of a specific ovarian cell type, terminal filament (tf) cells, determines ovariole number. here we examine tf cell development in different drosophila lineages that independently evolved a significantly lower ovariole number than the d. melanogaster oregon r strain. we show that in these drosophila lineages, reduction in ovariole number occurs primarily through variations in one of two different developmental mechanisms: (1) reduced number of somatic gonad precursors (sgp cells) specified during embryogenesis; or (2) alterations of somatic gonad cell morphogenesis and differentiation in larval life. mutations in the d. melanogaster insulin receptor (inr) alter sgp cell number but not ovarian morphogenesis, while targeted loss of function of bric à brac 2 (bab2) affects morphogenesis without changing sgp cell number. thus, evolution can produce similar ovariole numbers through distinct developmental mechanisms, likely controlled by different genetic mechanisms.",2012,23022298,Convergent evolution of a reproductive trait through distinct developmental mechanisms in Drosophila.

961,"because the ability of cells to replace oxidized fatty acids in membrane phospholipids via deacylation and reacylation in situ may be an important determinant of the ability of cells to tolerate oxidative stress, incorporation of exogenous fatty acid into phospholipid by human erythrocytes has been examined following exposure of the cells to t butyl hydroperoxide. exposure of human erythrocytes to t butyl hydroperoxide (0.5 1.0 mm) results in oxidation of glutathione, formation of malonyldialdehyde, and oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. under these conditions, incorporation of exogenous [9,10 3h]oleic acid into phosphatidylethanolamine is enhanced while incorporation of [9,10 3h]oleic acid into phosphatidylcholine is decreased. these effects of t butyl hydroperoxide on [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation are not affected by dissipating transmembrane gradients for calcium and potassium. when malonyldialdehyde production is inhibited by addition of ascorbic acid, t butyl hydroperoxide still decreases [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation into phosphatidylcholine but no stimulation of [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine occurs. in cells pre treated with nano2 to convert hemoglobin to methemoglobin, t butyl hydroperoxide reduces [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation into phosphatidylcholine by erythrocytes but does not stimulate [9,10 3h]oleic acid incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine. under these conditions oxidation of erythrocyte glutathione and formation of malonyldialdehyde still occur. these results indicate that membrane phospholipid fatty acid turnover is altered under conditions where peroxidation of membrane phospholipid fatty acids occurs and suggest that the oxidation state of hemoglobin influences this response.",1986,3718986,t-Butyl hydroperoxide alters fatty acid incorporation into erythrocyte membrane phospholipid.

the temporal and spatial expression of ku 70 corresponded to tolerance of the hippocampal ca1 neurons to subsequent ischemia, suggesting the involvement of ku proteins in the development of neuronal tolerance after ischemic preconditioning.",2001,11588331,Neuronal expression of the DNA repair protein Ku 70 after ischemic preconditioning corresponds to tolerance to global cerebral ischemia.
975,"exposure of molt 3 human leukemic cells in culture to a lipophilic antifolate, trimetrexate (tmq), resulted in the development of sublines resistant to antifolates as well as to drugs related to multidrug resistance. the tmq resistant sublines had an increase in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) activity and overexpression of p glycoprotein. in these sublines, neither the dhfr gene nor the mdr1 gene were amplified. in these cells, dhfr transcripts were also not overexpressed but dhfr protein was increased, indicative of translational or post translational control of dhfr activity. in contrast, mdr1 transcripts were found to be overexpressed, in parallel with p glycoprotein production. therefore, increases in p glycoprotein appear controlled at the transcriptional level. these data support evidence that tmq produced two phenotypic changes independently: the former probably from folate deficiency and the latter from the lipophilic nature of the compound.",1993,8099375,Expression of dihydrofolate reductase and multidrug resistance genes in trimetrexate-resistant human leukemia cell lines.
976,"the dependence of ca2+ induced permeability transition pore (ptp) opening and cytochrome c (cyt. c) release from mitochondria on mitochondria energetic status was investigated. results of test the ptp opening and cyt. c release of isolated rat liver mitochondria with different mitochondrial respiratory substrates, electron transport inhibitors and uncoupler by spectrophotometry and western blotting showed that, cyt. c release from mitochondria by ptp opening. ptp opening and cyt. c release showed more sensitive and responsive with fadh linked succinate than with nadh linked glutamate plus malate as substrate. partial or full inhibition of electron flow with electron flow inhibitors resulted in partial or full inhibition of ptp opening and cyt. c release, respectively. partial recovery of electron flow with electron sponsors resulted in partial recovery of ptp opening and cyt. c release. ptp opening and cyt. c release were completely interrupted by uncoupler. these results indicated ptp opening and cyt. c release are characterized by respiratory substrate selectivity, electron flow dependence and energy coupling reliance. hence, ptp opening and cyt. c release tightly depend on mitochondria energetic status. these findings suggested also that it is possible to regulate apoptosis by altering mitochondrial energetic status to alter ptp opening and cyt. c release.",2001,11693186,Dependence of permeability transition pore opening and cytochrome C release from mitochondria on mitochondria energetic status.

978,"the effect of methoxyflurane anesthesia on allyl alcohol induced hepatotoxicity and the metabolism of allyl alcohol was studied in male rats. hepatotoxicity was assessed by the measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase activity and histopathological examination. allyl alcohol induced hepatotoxicity was enhanced when allyl alcohol (32 mg/kg) was administered 4 hr before or up to 8 days after a single 10 min exposure to methoxyflurane vapors. the possibility that methoxyflurane increases alcohol dehydrogenase dependent oxidation of allyl alcohol to acrolein, the proposed toxic metabolite, was evaluated by measuring the rate of acrolein formation in the presence of allyl alcohol and liver cytosol. the effect of methoxyflurane on alcohol dehydrogenase activity in liver cytosol was also assessed by measuring the rate of nad+ utilization in the presence of ethyl alcohol or allyl alcohol. alcohol dehydrogenase activity and rate of acrolein formation were elevated in methoxyflurane pretreated rats. the results suggest that a modest increase in alcohol dehydrogenase activity and rate of acrolein formation markedly enhances allyl alcohol induced hepatotoxicity.", ,2565200,Methoxyflurane enhances allyl alcohol hepatotoxicity in rats.

981,"chronic proliferative dermatitis in mice (cpdm) is a spontaneous multiorgan inflammatory disorder with pathological hallmarks similar to atopic dermatitis and psoriasis in humans. cpdm mice lack expression of shank associated rh domain interacting protein, an adaptor of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex, which acts in the nf κb pathway to promote inflammation and protect from apoptosis and necroptosis. although skin inflammation in cpdm mice is driven by tnf  and ripk1 induced cell death, the contribution of initiating innate immunity sensors and additional inflammatory pathways remains poorly characterized. in this article, we show that inflammasome signaling, including the expression and activation of the inflammatory caspase 1 and  11 and il 1 family cytokines, was highly upregulated in the skin of cpdm mice prior to overt disease onset. genetic ablation of caspase 1 and  11 from cpdm mice significantly reduced skin inflammation and delayed disease onset, whereas systemic immunological disease persisted. loss of nlrp3 also attenuated skin disease, albeit more variably. strikingly, induction of apoptosis and necroptosis effectors was sharply decreased in the absence of caspase 1 and  11. these results position the inflammasome as an important initiating signal in skin disease pathogenesis and provide novel insights about inflammasome and cell death effector cross talk in the context of inflammatory diseases.",2015,26216893,The Inflammatory Caspases-1 and -11 Mediate the Pathogenesis of Dermatitis in Sharpin-Deficient Mice.
982,"the transcription factor pacc, mediating regulation of gene expression by ambient ph in the genetically amenable fungus aspergillus nidulans, contains a three zinc finger dna binding domain (zf dbd) including a nuclear localisation signal (nls). we selected 38 novel mutations impairing pacc function, of which 21 missense mutations identify individual residues essential for zf dbd structure/function. our functional analysis agrees with our previous conclusion that finger 1 does not bind dna and provides in vivo evidence that trp80 and trp116, located in the cys knuckles of adjacent zinc fingers, are critical for zf dbd structure/function. in the finger 3 alpha helix, gln155 (+4) is specifically involved in contacting dna, while the major role of lys159 (+6) resides in the nuclear localisation of the protein. in contrast, lys158 is essential for dna binding and for nuclear localisation. as finger 3 suffices to drive nuclear localisation of green fluorescent protein, we conclude that it contains an nls including essential lys158 and lys159. these residues are within an alpha helical basic sequence that is completely conserved amongst zinc fingers of the pacc/rim101 family and present in an identical position of the last finger alpha helix of drosophila cubitus interruptus, where it is also involved in nuclear localisation. we propose that pacc and gli/ci zf dbds belong to a subclass of these domains characterised by possession of a pair of conserved trp residues involved in the interaction between the two most n terminal fingers and the presence of an nls in the alpha helix of the most c terminal finger. loss of pacc nuclear localisation resulting from his142leu (beta strand) and phe151ser (hydrophobic core) substitutions in finger 3 suggests that its folding is required for nls function. overlap of dna binding and nls may aid release of pacc from its cognate importer(s) upon nuclear translocation, as suggested for zinc binuclear cluster proteins.",2003,14636595,Overlap of nuclear localisation signal and specific DNA-binding residues within the zinc finger domain of PacC.

986,"the inadequate proliferative response of the visceral glomerular epithelial cell (gec) following injury in vivo may contribute to the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis in many forms of glomerular disease. cell proliferation is ultimately controlled by cell cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclins that bind to cyclin dependent kinases (cdk), and the active complex formed is necessary for progression through the cell cycle. by inhibiting cyclin cdk complexes, cyclin kinase inhibitors arrest the cell cycle and prevent proliferation. to determine the mechanisms that may be responsible for the lack of gec proliferation in vivo, we examined gec expression of specific cell cycle proteins in normal rats and in the passive heymann nephritis (phn) model of membranous nephropathy, where the gec are the target of complement mediated injury. following antibody deposition and complement activation there was a marked up regulation in the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 in rats with phn. by associating with cyclin a cdk2 complexes, p21 and p27 limited the kinase activity of cdk2. giving bfgf to rats with phn was associated with an increase in gec mitosis and ploidy and a decrease in expression of p21, but not cdk2 or p27. furthermore, apoptosis was not present in phn, but was increased in rats given bfgf. in conclusion, this study shows that the low proliferative capacity of the gec in vivo in response to immune injury may be due to an increase in the expression of specific cyclin kinase inhibitors. the increase in mitosis in phn rats given bfgf may be due to a decrease in p21. thus, changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins may regulate the response of gec to injury and underlie the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis in diseases of the gec.",1997,9263996,Cyclin kinase inhibitors are increased during experimental membranous nephropathy: potential role in limiting glomerular epithelial cell proliferation in vivo.

989,"the rd7 mouse is a model for hereditary retinal degeneration characterized clinically by retinal spotting throughout the fundus and late onset retinal degeneration, and histologically by retinal dysplasia manifesting as folds and whorls in the photoreceptor layer. this study demonstrates that the rd7 phenotype results from a splicing error created by a genomic deletion of an intron and part of an exon. hematoxylin/eosin staining of rd7 tissue shows that the whorls in the outer nuclear layer of the retina do not appear during embryonic development but manifest by postnatal day 12.5 (p12.5). furthermore, in situ hybridization data indicates that the nr2e3 message is first present at barely discernable levels at embryonic day 18.5, becomes abundant by p2.5, and reaches maximal adult levels by p10.5. results from these experiments indicate that nr2e3 message is expressed prior to the development of s cones. this data coincides with studies in humans showing that mutations in nr2e3 result in a unique type of retinal degeneration known as enhanced s cone syndrome, where patients have a 30 fold increase in s cone sensitivity compared to normal. immunohistochemical staining of cone cells demonstrates that rd7 retinas have an increased number of cone cells compared to wild type retinas. thus, nr2e3 may function by regulating genes involved in cone cell proliferation, and mutations in this gene lead to retinal dysplasia and degeneration by disrupting normal photoreceptor cell topography as well as cell cell interactions.",2001,11487564,Excess cone cell proliferation due to lack of a functional NR2E3 causes retinal dysplasia and degeneration in rd7/rd7 mice.

992,"proteins of the nuclear envelope have been implicated as participating in gene silencing. baf, a dna  and lem domain binding protein, has been suggested to link chromatin to the nuclear envelope. we have previously shown that lap2beta, a lem domain inner nuclear membrane protein, represses transcription through binding to hdac3 and induction of histone h4 deacetylation. we now show that lap2zeta, the smallest lap2 family member, is also involved in regulation of transcription. we show that similar to other lem domain proteins lap2zeta interacts with baf. lap2zeta yfp and baf co localize in the cytoplasm, and overexpression of lap2zeta leads to reduction of nucleoplasmic baf. mutations in the lap2zeta yfp lem domain decrease its interaction with baf retaining the nucleo cytoplasmic distribution of baf. co expression of lap2beta and lap2zeta results in inhibition of lap2beta induced gene silencing while overexpression of lap2zeta alone leads to a small increase in transcriptional activity of various transcription factors. our results suggest that lap2zeta is a transcriptional regulator acting predominantly to inhibit lap2beta mediated repression. lap2zeta may function by decreasing availability of baf. these findings could have implications in the study of nuclear lamina associated diseases and baf dependent retroviral integration.",2008,18403046,LAP2zeta binds BAF and suppresses LAP2beta-mediated transcriptional repression.
993,"translational pausing can lead to cleavage of the a site codon and facilitate recruitment of the transfer messenger rna (tmrna) (ssra) quality control system to distressed ribosomes. we asked whether aminoacyl trna binding site (a site) mrna cleavage occurs during regulatory translational pausing using the escherichia coli secm mediated ribosome arrest as a model. we find that secm ribosome arrest does not elicit efficient a site cleavage, but instead allows degradation of downstream mrna to the 3' edge of the arrested ribosome. characterization of secm arrested ribosomes shows the nascent peptide is covalently linked via glycine 165 to trna(3gly) in the peptidyl trna binding site, and prolyl trna(2pro) is bound to the a site. although a site cleaved mrnas were not detected, tmrna mediated ssra tagging after secm glycine 165 was observed. this tmrna activity results from sequestration of prolyl trna(2pro) on overexpressed secm arrested ribosomes, which produces a second population of stalled ribosomes with unoccupied a sites. indeed, compensatory overexpression of trna(2pro) readily inhibits ssra tagging after glycine 165, but has no effect on the duration of secm ribosome arrest. we conclude that, under physiological conditions, the architecture of secm arrested ribosomes allows regulated translational pausing without interference from a site cleavage or tmrna activities. moreover, it seems likely that a site mrna cleavage is generally avoided or inhibited during regulated ribosome pauses.",2006,16968693,Prolyl-tRNA(Pro) in the A-site of SecM-arrested ribosomes inhibits the recruitment of transfer-messenger RNA.
